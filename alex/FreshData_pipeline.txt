The 8 experimental conditions (Rest/Task Left/Right finger tapping 2s/3s) were modelled in the design matrix alongside the short separation channels (that survived the QT-NIRS quality assessment). The boxcar functions reflecting the 8 experimental conditions were convolved with the canonical Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF) made of two gamma functions. A negative HRF was used to fit the HbR time-series. The design matrix then included the following regressors: Rest left finger tapping 2s, Task left finger tapping 2s, Rest left finger tapping 3s, Task left finger tapping 3s, Rest right finger tapping 2s, Task right finger tapping 2s, Rest right finger tapping 3s, Task right finger tapping 3s, short separation channels plus the constant term of the model.

This bin threshold was determined by manual inspection of HRF forms and distribution of bin lengths across the whole dataset, both HRF forms (typical HRF forms were observed in the data with these thresholds) and the distribution (a visible cut at 10) supported the choice.

2) Then, channels with poor signal quality were determined with the coefficient of variation (CV) method (Piper et al., 2014; Pollonini et al., 2016; Hocke et al. 2018; Zimeo et al.2018). CV was computed as a percentage via CV (%) = 100 × standard deviation (data)/mean (data) where “data” refers to channel specific raw optical signals at 760 nm or 850 nm.  Channels with raw light intensity signals above a CV  of 7.5%  were considered to be heavily contaminated with unphysiological noise and will be excluded from further processing (Hocke et al., 2018; Zimeo et al.,2018; Mutlu et al., 2020). Subjects whose fNIRS data contained more than 5 low-signal quality channels were excluded from further analysis. Only Subject 2 was excluded based on this criteria.
3) For the remaining subjects, channels with raw light intensity signals were removed from the analysis if SNR was less than 2 for any wavelength data by using the hmrR_PruneChannels function (SNRthresh = 2). 
4) Data segments with motion artifacts were detected per each channel with h hmrR_MotionArtifactByChannel function with the following parameters: tMotion = 0.5, tMask = 1, STDEVthresh = 5, and AMPthresh = 3 (Huppert, 2009). The raw intensity data were converted into optical density (OD) data with the hmrR_Intensity2OD function. Spikes and drifts in channel OD data were initially corrected with hmrR_MotionCorrectSplineSG function with the following parameters: p: 0.99 and FrameSize_sec: 10.

5) Motion corrected OD data were converted to HB data with the hmrR_OD2Conc function with DPF set to 1 for each wavelength. 
6) HBO and HBR data were bandpassfiltered with cut-off frequencies 0.01-0.5 Hz using a Butterworth filter embedded in hmrR_BandpassFilt function. 

7) Further traces of motion artifacts were corrected with the Correlation based signal improvement method (CBSI) by use of the hmrR_MotionCorrectCbsi function. 

8) From each long separation HB and HBO channel time series, data of the short channel with highest correlation was linearly regressed out utilizing a GLM procedure.

9) Each block data was truncated with a prestimulus baseline of 3 seconds and poststimulus interval of 10 seconds. A linear trend was removed from each truncated block signal with the detrend function of MATLAB. 

10) Truncated block time series were averaged across all blocks for each channel, stimulus and subject.

Channel Coregistration

The sensitivity of the probe for detecting brain hemodynamics was calculated with the method explained in Aasted et al. (2015). The channel locations were coregistered onto a standard brain in MNI space using the NIRS_SPM toolbox (Singh et al., 2005; Jang et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2009).  As the last step, the percentage of Brodmann areas covered by each channel were computed with the spatial registration toolbox of NIRS_SPM according to the Rorden’s brain atlas (Rorden and Brett, 2001) and Talairach Atlases. Channel 8 corresponded to left Heschl’s gyrus and Channel 32 corresponded to right Heschl s Gyrus with highest percentage of overlap. Similarly Channels 1,3,4, 6 corresponded to LIFG and Channels 16,17,19,20,21,22,23,24 corresponded to Occipital Cortex.

Computation of the Neurovascular Coupling Parameter 
10) We took a grand average of all block time series across all subjects, channels and stimuli for each experimental task and determined a time window after the stimulus onset that involved the peak amplitude of the hemodynamic response. For auditory data, the hemodynamic signals had an average peak response around 5.7 seconds with a standard deviation of 0.6 seconds.  Hence, we took the mean signal between a time window of 5 and 8 seconds from stimulus onset for block averaged signals of each channel and stimulus type as the signal of interest. We computed a Cohen’s D parameter for signal amplitude at this time window with the following formula:
 CD=(mean(activation period)-mean (baseline period))/Standard Deviation(baseline period).
Where activation period refers to time interval from 5 to 8 seconds and baseline period refers to time interval for prestimulus baseline of 3 seconds. The difference in mean amplitude of activation and baseline was normalized by scaling with the standard deviation of baseline amplitude.
Hypothesis Testing
Each hypothesis was tested with a bootstrapping methodology that involved permutation testing procedures.
For each channel and subject, we computed a Cohen’s D value for each trial of silent, noise, and speech conditions independently, resulting in 16 subject x 25 channel x 3 conditions. Then, hypotheses 1-6 were tested via non-parametric bootstrap tests by generating pseudo-conditions via bootstrapping.
As an example, for the first hyopthesis, we obtained two 16x1 vectors consisting of Cohen’s D values for speech and silent conditions. Silent condition was used as a baseline for this hypothesis. Then, the observed difference between these two conditions were computed by first taking their average, followed by subtracting the average of silent from the average of the speech condition. Then, we pooled these two vectors, resampled 1000 times, resulting in different pseudo-silent and pseudo-speech conditions in each time. For each resampling, the difference between the mean value of two vectors were computed. As a result, we obtained 1000 average differences. Then, we calculated the significance of the observed difference via the following formula:
p=(? # (CD?_bs>? CD?_obs))/nboot
where CDbs  denotes Cohen’s D value difference between pseudocomnditions for each bootstrapping, CDobs denotes the observed difference between the means of two conditions , # (CDbs > CDobs) denotes the number of bootstrapped Cohen’s D difference values that are greater than the observed average difference between silent and speech trials, and nboot denotes the total number of bootstrapping (n=1000).
Hypotheses 2-6 had a very similar mathematical architecture and we will give a detailed explanation in our second report.

For hypthesis 7, we first computed the Cohen’s D parameter from the block averaged signals of each channel and subject that belonged to silent condition. (Please note that for each channel, the number of NVC parameter (i.e., Cohen’s D) in the silent data vector equals the number of included subjects for that channel. Subject 2 was completely excluded from the analysis.) 
We then resampled Cohen’s D parameter in each ROI channel 1000 times with replacement and calculated the average Cohen’s D parameter of each sampling, resulting in a distribution of average Cohen’s D values. 
Then, we computed the p-value of the bootstrap test by calculating the percentage of bootstrapped average Cohen’s D values greater than zero as in the following:
p=1-(? # (CD?_bs>0))/nboot	 			(2)
where # (CDbs > 0) denotes the number of bootstrapped average Cohen’s D is greater than zero, and nboot denotes the total number of bootstrapping (n=1000).

To sum up, the analysis pipeline can be summarized as follows

	Exclusion of Subjects with more than 5 bad quality channels (based on CV method with CV threshold set to 7.5 )
	Channel exclusion at the subject level with poor SNR criteria (hmrR_PruneChannels function (SNRthresh = 2).

Data from the GLM estimation of the HRF (variable output.dcAvg.timeSeries) were extracted for each participant. Then, the mean time courses of the estimated HRF were computed for each condition (silence, speech, and noise) and for each region of interest ROI (Left Inferior Frontal Gyrus, left and right superior temporal [Heschl's] gyrus, and occipital).  Channels corresponding to each ROI were chosen as described by Luke et al.3. From these averaged time courses baseline conditions were extracted from the average of two seconds before stimulus onset, and the corresponding response was computed as the maximum HbO signal between 5 and 7 seconds post-stimuli onset. 
Normality was not tested with Shapiro-Wilk or any other tests, due to the relatively small sample size (n=17) non-normality was assumed. A Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine if there was a significant difference between the median of any two groups involved in the hypotheses under test. This is a non-parametric test, appropriate for paired data. A level of alpha=0.05 was considered for statistical significance. Since a few ROI were chosen a priori, no corrections for false positives were carried out (false-discovery rate, Bonferroni, etc.) 7,8. A two-tailed test was used to assess activation with respect to baseline (hypotheses 1,  4,  6, and 7 ) while one-tailed test was used when a response was expected to be larger in a specific ROI (hypotheses  2, 3, and 5).

Data from the GLM estimation of the HRF (variable output.dcAvg. dataTimeSeries and output.dcAvgStd.dataTimeSeries) were extracted for each participant. Then, the mean time courses of the estimated HRF were computed for each condition (2 sec. left finger-tapping, 3 sec. left finger-tapping, 2 sec. right finger-tapping & 3 sec. right finger-tapping).  From these averaged time courses baseline conditions were extracted from the average of two seconds before stimulus onset, and the corresponding response was computed as the mean HbO signal between 2 and 4 seconds post-stimuli onset in the case of the 2-second stimuli or between 3 and 5 seconds in the case of the stimuli of 3-second duration. 
A paired t-test was used to determine if there was a significant difference between the mean HRF, the mean baseline and their corresponding standard deviations. A level of alpha=0.05 was considered for statistical significance. Since this is a channel-by-channel comparison, corrections for false positives were carried out (Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate) 10. A two-tailed test was used to assess activation with respect to baseline (hypotheses 1,  2 and 3 ) while one-tailed test was used when a response was expected to be larger in a specific condition (hypothesis  4). For the exploratory tests, the two conditions (left and right finger-tapping, both durations combined) were contrasted.
