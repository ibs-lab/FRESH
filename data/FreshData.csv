According to reference 1, the following channels were determined to be sensitive to the pre-central gyrus (= primary motor cortex)
right channels [43 44 47 48 49 50 54 55 56 58 59]
left channels [ 9 10 13 14 15 16 20 21 23 24 25].
[Preprocessing]
- Conducted by Open PoTATo
- Correct baseline by polynomial fitting
- Bandpass filter [0.01 1.00] Hz.
- Hemodynamic Modality Separation separates the signal into a systemic component and a functional component.(2)
- Create segmented data based on task onset (onset as t = 0, [-3 15])
- Write the segmented data so that the value of the change based on the onset of the task (t = 0 for onset [-3 15]).
- Modified the classification data so that the value of the change in hemoglobin concentration at the time of task onset is 0.
[Statistical test]
- Conducted in Open PoTATo
- For each trial, calculate the average value of the functional component of oxyHb for [-3 0] and [4 7] seconds, respectively.
Paired t-tests were performed on the mean values before and after the onset for each channel.
If p<0.05/11 for either the channel on the contralateral side of the tapping (e.g., right channels for left tapping), the result was considered statistically significant.

The power-spectrum density of raw fNIRS data for each channel and participant were visually examined with Homer3 to ensure that the heart-rate frequency was visible in the spectrum. If not, the corresponding channel was removed prior to further analyses. All participants combined, 10.12% of the channels were discarded following this criterion.

The QT-NIRS toolbox was additionally used to identify channels with a poor scalp-coupling index (SCI threshold = .6, PSP threshold = .1). For each participant, a channel with a global quality < .7 was removed prior to further analyses. All participants combined, 22.40% of additional channels were discarded following this criterion. Participants 2, 3, 8, 9, 13 and 14 were removed prior to further analyses because < 60% of their channels had a sufficient scalp-coupling index. In addition, three channels were removed because they were identified as having a poor scalp-coupling index in more than half of the participants.

The cleaned raw fNIRS data were filtered in Homer3 using a wavelet transform (interquartile range = 1.5) and a fourth-order Butterworth filter with a band pass of 0–0.5 Hz. Note that the short channels were not taken in consideration during preprocessing because they are not part of our ‘usual analysis approach’ (i.e., our fNIRS equipment do not offer short-channel facilities). For each trial, channel and participant, a delta value for the oxygenated-hemoglobin (HbO2) index was computed by subtracting the mean baseline (i.e., -2–0 s) from the mean plateau value (i.e., 5–7 s). Then, the HbO2 delta values were averaged per condition and region of interest.

Raw intensity data were then imported into Homer3 and converted into optical density. Participants that did not have at least 60% of the channels valid were excluded from further analysis (N=7).
Hereafter, motion was corrected with wavelet (iqr=1.5) and data were bandpass filtered (0.01-0.3 Hz). Data were then converted into concentration changes using the modified Beer-Lambert law (ppf=6, 6). Last, the haemodynamic response was estimated with a GLM-based approach by fitting the preprocessed HbO2 and HbR signals with a series of gaussian functions with standard deviation of 1 s and spaced out by 1 s over the time range [-2 10] s respect to the stimuli onsets. The design matrix also included short separation channels; in particular, for each long separation channel, the short separation signal with the highest correlation was regressed out. The beta values were then estimated using the ordinary least square method.
               The mean of the hemodynamic change from 2 to 10 seconds post-stimulus onset was extracted for each channel for both chromophores.
               Regions of interest (ROI) were calculated following Luke et al. 2021 by averaging the mean of the hemodynamic changes of the channels belonging to Left IFG, Left STG, Right STG, Occipital.

Channels 1,3, 4, 6 were considered belonging to IFG; Channels 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 were considered for left STG; Channels 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32 for right STG; Channels 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 belonged to the Occipital region.

[Note: 7 subjects (2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13) did not meet the criterion for data quality (i.e. at least 60% of channels marked as good quality by QT-NIRS). So we believe that our analysis on 10 subjects lacked of statistical power.]
 ";"fNIRS data pre-processing was carried out using the Homer3 software package combined with the QT-NIRS toolbox for the assessment of data quality. 
Raw intensity signals at the two wavelenghts were first entered into QT-NIRS to identify noisy channels to be excluded for further analyses. the scalp contact index (SCI) and the peak spectral power (PSP) were computed within not overlapping time windows (3 s long) and each time window is marked as high quality or low quality if both indices exceed or not a user-defined threshold (?_SCI and ?_PSP). The fNIRS channels were flagged as noisy and hence excluded from further analyses if they did not meet the Scan Quality threshold ?_SQ, i.e. a certain percentage of time windows need to be marked as high-quality. Here, we used ?_SCI= 0.7, ?_PSP=0.1, and ?_SQ=70%. 
Only participants with at least 60% of good channels were included in the analyses. In particular, subject 06 was excluded for this reason.
After noisy channels were identified, raw intensity signals were entered into Homer3 and converted into changes in optical density (hmrR_Intensity2OD). Motion artifacts were identified and corrected using the wavelet-based correction method (hmrR_MotionCorrectWavelet, iqr=1.5); signals were then band-pass filtered in the range [0.01-0.3] Hz (hmr_BandpassFilt: Bandpass_Filter_OpticalDensity) and converted into changes in concentration in HbO2 and HbR considering a DPF of 6 for both wavelenghts (hmrR_OD2Conc). 
This process was applied to each of the four sessions of each participant.
The preprocessed signals in HbO2 and HbR were contatenated across the 4 sessions and analysed with a General Linear Model (GLM) approach using the SPM for fNIRS package. The 8 experimental conditions (Rest/Task Left/Right finger tapping 2s/3s) were modelled in the design matrix alongside the short separation channels (that survived the QT-NIRS quality assessment). The boxcar functions reflecting the 8 experimental conditions were convolved with the canonical Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF) made of two gamma functions. A negative HRF was used to fit the HbR time-series. The design matrix then included the following regressors: Rest left finger tapping 2s, Task left finger tapping 2s, Rest left finger tapping 3s, Task left finger tapping 3s, Rest right finger tapping 2s, Task right finger tapping 2s, Rest right finger tapping 3s, Task right finger tapping 3s, short separation channels plus the constant term of the model. This was used to fit the fNIRS data from the long-separation channels, for HbO2 and HbR separately.
Single-subject beta values and corresponding t-values were estimated for each channel and for each regressor; a contrast-effect analysis was then carried out to test the following hypotheses:
Contrast 1: Left-hand finger tapping of 2-sec duration evokes a response in the contralateral primary motor cortex.
Contrast 2: Left AND right hand finger tapping of 2 sec duration, conditions combined, evokes a response in the contralateral primary motor cortex.
Contrast 3: Left AND right hand finger tapping of 2 AND 3 sec duration, conditions combined, evokes a response in the contralateral primary motor cortex.
Contrast 4:Left AND right hand finger tapping of 3 sec duration, conditions combined, evokes a greater response in the contralateral primary motor cortex than left AND right.
First level results were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR) at 0.05 significant level.
Channels were considered as ""functionally active"" if the contrasts resulted significant (p<0.05 FDR corrected) for both HbO2 and HbR.
In order to identify the channels belonging to right and left primary motor cortices, the spatial information reported in the paper by Novi et al. (2020) were used. We then considered: Channels 9,12,13,22,23 for the left primary motor cortex; Channels 41, 44, 45, 54, 55 for right motor cortex. 
To answer the questions in the form, we checked if any of the channels belonging to the controlateral hemisphere to the stimulation (i.e. the right motor cortex) were statistically active (both HbO2 and HbR).

Here, we used ?_SCI= 0.7, ?_PSP=0.1, and ?_SQ=70%. 
Only participants with at least 60% of good channels were included in the analyses. In particular, subject 06 was excluded for this reason.
After noisy channels were identified, raw intensity signals were entered into Homer3 and converted into changes in optical density (hmrR_Intensity2OD).

Contrast 4:Left AND right hand finger tapping of 3 sec duration, conditions combined, evokes a greater response in the contralateral primary motor cortex than left AND right.
First level results were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR) at 0.05 significant level.

Study 1;11;No;0;"Strictly, no. According to the Juelich Atlas, implemented in the fOLD toolbox, there is no possible source detector pair, placed on EEG 10-10 positions that reaches Heschl’s gyrus (0% specificity). Thus, we believe it is not possible to address this hypothesis. However, when considering the channel T7-C5, which might be closest to HG, as left auditory region of interest (55% specificity for middle temporal gyrus, 22% for STG), we do see responses evoked by speech stimuli detected by this channel (hbo speech beta = 1.82, p-value < 0.001, q-value < 0.001; Hbr speech beta = -1.15, p-value < 0.001, q-value < 0.001). 

Please notice that it was not possible to submit the formatting “<0.001”, so we added 0.000 instead.
";No;3;"Strictly, no, but yes, when considering again channel T7-C5 as region of interest for testing this hypothesis. We see larger responses to speech contrasted to noise stimuli on the LME group results (hbo beta-difference= 1.04, p = 0.003, q = 0.037; hbr beta-difference = -0.62, p < 0.001, q = 0.0152). ";No;846;"Again, strictly we cannot address this hypothesis. Similar to the left HG, according to the Juelich Atlas, implemented in the fOLD toolbox, there is no possible source detector pair, placed on EEG 10-10 positions that reaches the right HG (0% specificity). However, as an approximation the channel T8-C6 was considered, which had 54% specificity for the Superior Temporal Gyrus and 31% for the Middle Temporal Gyrus. First, we had a look at the group results for responses evoked by speech in this channel and found significant activation (hbo speech beta = 1.25, p-value < 0.001, q-value < 0.001; hbr speech beta = -1.17, p-value < 0.001, q-value < 0.001). Next, comparing to the beta values found for the left ROI in hypothesis 1 (hbo speech beta = 1.82, p-value < 0.001, q-value < 0.001; Hbr speech beta = -1.15, p-value < 0.001, q-value < 0.001), we see that the hbo beta value of the left HG is larger than that of the right HG. To test this difference statistically, we fitted a linear mixed model with ROI as fixed effect and subject as random effect on the first-level GLM results, which indicated that this difference was not statistically significant (beta = -0.15, t = -0.2, p = 0.846).  ";Yes;3;"Yes, but a negative response. A criterium of at least 35% specificity was implemented in the FOLD toolbox to consider the channels to investigate for the left inferior frontal gyrus and the following channels remained, which had at least 50% specificity:  F7-F5, FC5-F5, and AF7-F5. Significant, but negative values were found to speech stimuli (Hbo speech beta = -0.61, p=0.003, q=0.016; Hbr speech beta = -0.22, p=0.006, q=0.016). 
Furthermore, as a comparison we also ran an analysis with the GLM regressor amplitudes set at different weights, as given in the dataset. In this case we found positive hbo beta values and negative hbr beta values for the speech condition, however, both were not significant. Consequently, we noticed that changing the GLM regressor amplitudes weights makes a difference in the obtained results and conclusions. 
";No;83;No. As in H4, we considered channels F7-F5, FC5-F5, and AF7-F5, but could not find significantly larger responses evoked to speech compared to noise, using a contrast, in the LIFG (hbo beta-difference = - 0.43, p = 0.083, q = 0.165). ;Yes;0;"Yes, but a negative response. To decide on the channels that define the occipital cortex, again a 35% specificity criterium was set in the FOLD toolbox for the superior, middle, and inferior occipital gyrus. The following channels remained: O1-PO3, O1-Oz, POz-PO3, POz-Oz, POz-PO4, O2-PO4, and O2-Oz. Again, significant but negative values were found (hbo speech beta = -1.32, p < 0.001, q < 0.001; hbr speech beta = -0.18, p = 0.017, q = 0.034). ";No;165;No. When using the channels as in H6, the responses in the control condition were not significant (hbo control beta = -0.38, p = 0.165, q= 0.216). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Initial comments
When loading the data with nirstoolbox (matlab) the different amplitudes are assigned to the different stimulus conditions (1 for Control, 2 for Noise, 3 for Speech). We were assuming that this was done on purpose to induce the assumption of speech evoking a larger response than noise. However, we did not find any explanation in the paper (Luke et al. 2021) regarding this. Because we did not know how to interpret beta-values and contrasts resulting from the conditions modelled with different amplitudes, we decided to set them to 1 for all our analyses. Later, we saw that when loading the data in MNE, and plotting the design matrix there, the amplitudes are equal. We assume that the “values” from the .evt file which probably have been trigger codes got interpreted as amplitudes in the nirstoolbox. 
Also, z-coordinates were missing in the “probe.optodes” field which made it difficult for us to define the right source-detector pairs for each location. We think this may have also been due to some conversion between formats. See Fig. 1 for the probe we reconstructed by using information from the x and y coordinates only, and comparing it to the listed locations in the paper.

Methods 
The data was analyzed using Matlab R2022b and the nirs-toolbox (Santosa et al., 2018). 
First, the Scalp Coupling Index (SCI) was calculated on the raw intensity signals. An SCI threshold of 0.7 was used as a rejection criterium, i.e., channels with SCIs below this threshold were labelled as bad and removed. Then, the raw intensity signals were converted to optical density. Next, motion artifacts were removed using the Temporal Derivative Distribution Repair (Fishburn et al., 2019). 
The signal was then filtered using a fifth order butterworth bandpass filter with edges 0.02 and 0.7 Hz to remove slow drifts and the heartbeat. 
The beer-Lambert Law was then used to convert the signal to oxy- and de-oxyhemoglobin concentration. 
Source and detector labels were matched to the landmark locations according to the minimal distance and using the coordinate .tsv file (see table below). 
See table in attached file for used sources and landmarks. 
We fitted the fNIRS responses to a canonical general linear model (GLM) convolved with a boxcar function with a width of the stimulus duration of 5.25s for all conditions and added the principal components of all short channels as nuisiance regressors in the GLM to remove physiological noise from the data. We set the GLM regressor amplitudes to 1 for all conditions, such that they have equal weights, even though the different conditions in the Audio data were given different amplitudes. 
Furthermore, we used the LMM statistical test of the nirs toolbox on the group level data, which uses a Benjamini-Hochberg correction for the q-value. 
We always looked at both the hbo and hbr results for each condition. However, as a criterium for deciding significant responses, we look at the beta values (best fit estimates from the model) of the hbo only.

This however turned out not to be straight forward, and we did not manage to combine the datasets into one with several conditions, using the nirstoolbox. (We converted raw light intensity data into optical density for the different datasets first, to make sure potentially different gain settings and light intensities recorded in the different datasets are normalized. Afterwards we adjusted the time vector and stimulus onsets and condition name in order to combine them into one object. Nevertheless, we get different results out of the glm when comparing the same condition in the merged dataset to the separate one). Therefore, we could only look at the results of different conditions separately and addressed the hypotheses by logically combining the answers for the separate conditions. But ideally, only one statistical test is used.

Study 1;13;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Dataset 1 not investigated;"Introduction:
This work focuses on the motor dataset and addresses the hypotheses 1 to 4 at the individual level. The dataset was processed in Python with the MNE [Gramfort13], MNE-NIRS[Luke21], MNE-BIDS [Appelhoff19], Nilearn [Abraham14] and Statsmodels [Seabold10] libraries.

Pre-processing:
For each subject, each session and each channel (long and short), the data were processed as follows:
1. Conversion to optical density (function mne.preprocessing.nirs.optical_density) 
2. Identification of ""bad"" channels. Two measures of data quality were combined:
    a. the Scalp Coupling Index (SCI) that detects bad scalp-optode coupling based on the correlation between the HbO and HbR signals filtered around the heart rate. The threshold was set to 0.8 as recommended in [Pollonini16] (function mne.preprocessing.nirs.scalp_coupling_index)
    b. the Peak Spectral Power (PSP) is the spectal power of the correlation between the HbO and HbR signals filtered around the heart rate. It looks at the frequency composition of the SCI signal. The threshold was set to 0.1 as recommanded in [Pollonini16]
    c. A channel was labeled as bad if both its associated SCI and PSP were too low (i.e. SCI < 0.8 and PSP < 0.1).
3. Correction of motion artifacts with a temporal derivative distribution repair (TDDR) approach [Fishburn19] (function mne.preprocessing.nirs.temporal_derivative_distribution_repair)
4. Conversion to hemoglobin concentration changes, ?HbO and ?HbR, using the modified Beer-Lambert law with PPF=6 [Delpy88] (function mne.preprocessing.nirs.beer_lambert_law)
5. Filtering of physiological noise (heart and respiratory rate, Mayer wave and low frequency drift) with a bandpass filter according to [Pinti19] recommendations, i.e. FIR filter type with cutoff frequencies set to [0.01Hz, 0.09Hz] and a transition band of 0.01Hz (function mne.io.BaseRaw.filter). Filtering physiological noise is not a consensual method as [Yucel21]'s paper is not recommanding it.

Short channels were processed separately from long channels starting here.

Data analysis:

A GLM analysis was conducted to address the FRESH hypotheses at the individual level.

GLM specification and estimation
For each participant, one design matrix combining all four sessions was built. Thus, the same multi-sessions design matrix, X, was used for inference on ?HbO and ?HbR and for all the 4 FRESH hypotheses to be addressed.

The X matrix was created as a four-block matrix, each block Xi corresponding to the design matrix of a given session Si (see figure 1) was produced with this function mne_nirs.experimental_design.make_first_level_design_matrix. The haemodynamic response to the stimulus of session i was modeled as the convolution of the canonical HRF (gamma function, tr=0.112) with the ith task duration and onsets time series task. As the data were already filtered with a band pass filter, no drift regressors was added as it would have been redundant 
Both the ?HbO and the ?HbR signals from the short channels were averaged and included in Xi as two additional regressors.

Eventually, the GLM we used can be written as:
Y = XBeta + epsilon

with Y (somme ni, 1) the concatenation of the filtered data of the four sessions, X (somme ni, 4 nbeta) the design matrix described above and Beta (4nbeta, 1) the set of parameters to estimate.

In addition, an AR(1) autoregressive model was used to account for temporal autocorrelations.

The GLM was estimated with the an ordinary least square model (OLS) and an autocorrelation model with a parameter 1 using the following function : mne_nirs.statistics.run_glm.

Hypotheses testing (see Figure 2) 

The optical probe has 64 long channels (3 cm source-detector separation) and 4 short channels (0.8 cm source-detector separation) that are separated equaly on both hemisphere. [Novi20]

Channels that failed the quality checks were automaticaly considered as not activated and marked by a red cross. 
A channel was considered activated (in red) if the Beta value associated to the task was positive for HbO and negative for HbR. The signifance level was set to 0.05, with a False discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparison (for each test, we corrected for the number of long channels over the brain, ie 64 channels) 

A channel that did not check all these conditions was not considered activated and marked by a black cross.

Purple circle mark the channels located in the primary motor cortex, i.e. spanning the precentral gyrus. Channels S5_D13, S5_D16, S3_D2, S3_D8, S3_D9 for the left hemisphere and S12_D29, S12_D32, S10_D24, S10_D18, S10_D25 for the right hemisphere.

For hypothesis 1 : 
Inference was performed on the Beta values (for HbO and HbR) associated to the ""Left 2 sec"" task.
A subject validates hypothesis 1 if at least one of the channel on the contralateral (right) primary motor cortex (PMC, purple circles) is activated.

For hypothesis 2: 
For the right hemisphere, inference was performed on the Beta values (HbO and HbR) associated with the ""Left 2 sec"" task. For the left hemisphere, inference was performed  on the Beta values (HbO and HbR) associated with ""Right 2 sec"" task. 
Hypothese 2 is validated if at least one channel is activated on the primary motor cortex of each hemisphere.

For hypothesis 3: 
For the right hemisphere, inference was performed by a conjunction ananlysis based on the Beta values (HbO and HbR) associated with the ""Left 2 sec"" AND ""Left 3 sec"" tasks. For the left hemisphere, inference was performed by a conjunction ananlysis based on Beta values (HbO and HbR) associated with ""Right 2 sec"" AND ""Right 3 sec"" task. 
Hypothese 3 is validated if at least one channel is activated on the primary motor cortex of each hemisphere.

For hypothesis 4: 
For the right hemisphere, inference was performed on the beta values (HbO and HbR) associated with the ""left 3 sec"" if HbO beta values of ""left 3 sec"" task was signicantly higher than HbO beta values of ""left 2 sec"" task. On the left hemisphere, inference was performed on the beta values (HbO and HbR) associated with ""right 3 sec"" task if HbO beta values of ""right 3 sec"" task was signicantly higher than HbO beta values of ""right 2 sec"" task.

I noted this behavior just before submitting here, so I could not try to fix it. Basically this means that all results (for dataset 1) correspond to an analysis that did not check for bad channels.

The analysis of HbO for the Speech condition in the LHG revealed significantly high activation (t = 2.79, p = 0.007), while a similar analysis of HbR revealed no significant result (t = -0.35, p = 0.726). Significant HbO but not HbR analysis and also positive beta and t value for the HbO while negative beta and t value for the HbR show the reliability of the increased brain activation in the LHG during the Speech condition, and not non-brain or physiological change.";No;;The analysis of HbO for the contrast of Speech vs Noise in the LHG revealed only descriptively higher activation but not statistically (t = 1.25, p = 0.218). A similar analysis of HbR also revealed no significant result (t = 0.38, p = 0.708). These non-significant results go to the expected direction (i.e., higher activation in the LHG during Speech condition rather than Noise), however probably because of the small sample size and low power the findings are not statistically significant. The findings are reliable and related to brain activation rather than not non-brain or physiological change, because we observed positive beta and t value for HbO while positive but close-to-zero beta and t value for HbR.;No;;The analysis of HbO for the contrast of the LHG vs RHG in the Speech condition revealed only descriptively lower activation but not statistically (t = -0.30, p = 0.762).

These non-significant results go to the opposite direction (i.e., lower activation in the LHG than in the RHG during Speech condition), however probably because of the small sample size and low power the findings are not statistically significant.

While beta and t value are negative for both HbO and HbR, they are close to zero, which suggest strong evidence for no activation in the LIFG during the Speech condition.;No;;"As we mentioned above, no significant activation was observed in the LIFG during the Speech condition. The same was true for the Noise condition (t = 0.34, p = 0.738 for HbO, t = -0.59, p = 0.558 for HbR), while it showed reliable brain-related activation as increase in HbO was along with decrease in HbR.

fNIRS data preprocessing and analysis was performed using Satori 1.8.2 (Brain Innovation, the Netherlands)(Lührs and Goebel 2017). Raw data trimming was performed for all functional runs, cutting 5 seconds before the onset of the first experimental condition and 15 seconds after the offset of the last experimental condition. Experimental protocol was controlled to match the described in the peer-reviewed publication (conditions ‘Noise’ and ‘Control’ were set to 5 seconds and condition ‘Speech’ was set to 5.25 seconds) Data quality was assessed by computing the scalp-coupling (SCI) index (Pollonini et al. 2014), per channel (Figure 1). Participants presenting less than 50% of channels with an SCI below the threshold of 0.75 were excluded from the group analysis, with the final dataset being comprised of N = 13. Raw intensity signals were converted to changes in optical density calculated from the normalized changes in light intensity incident in the detector from its paired source position. Motion artifacts were mitigated using the temporal derivative distribution repair (TDDR) (Fishburn et al. 2019) motion correction method. Automatic identification and removal of spikes were performed, with variations over 3.5 in OD throughout a time lag of 5 seconds corrected using a monotonic interpolation. A General Linear Model (GLM) based short-channel regression (SSR) was performed for each channel, using as regressor the highest correlation short distance detector (SDD) data. A Butterworth 2nd-order high pass filter and a gaussian smoothing low pass filter, with cut-off frequencies of 0.01 – 0.4 Hz respectively,  were applied to remove low-frequency drifts as well as part of non-hemodynamic related signal components such as heart rate. Data were then converted to variations of concentration of oxy- and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbO and HbR) using the modified Beer-Lambert Law, incorporating a differential path length factor (DPF) of 6.40 and 5.75 for each wavelength and a z-transform normalization was performed. 

Channel of Interest selection
Aligning 3D probe positions based on landmark positions present in the probe information in each ‘snirf’ file, allowed for the correspondence of optode location to normalized MNI space. Using term-based meta-analyses on fMRI data (https://neurosynth.org/) and a public repository of fMRI based-data statistical maps (Gorgolewski et al. 2015), a selection of channels of interest, corresponding to the brain regions mentioned in the hypothesis tested was done. For left Heschl's gyri (HG), channels S5-D2 and S6-D2 were considered of interest. For right HG, channels S12-D12 and S11-D12 were considered of interest. Channels S4-D2 and S4-D1 were considered to cover the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG). Finally, all channels comprised of the combination of optodes S7-10 and D6-8 were considered to cover the occipital cortex.

Group-level analysis
A random effects (RFX-GLM) group-level analysis was performed, separating subject predictors of the experimental protocol (‘Control’, ‘Noise,’ ‘Speach’), to determine active cortical areas considering the contrasts for each hypothesis testing (N = 13, p < 0.05 uncorrected).

Hypothesis testing and Results Reporting
For each hypothesis, we report the statistical t-value from the group-level RFX-GLM contrast analysis, as well as the p-value, for each of the channels of interest active (if any), for both HbO and HbR. For all hypotheses, we considered it true if any channel within the channels of interest aforementioned described for the respective brain region appears to have a significant activation for both HbO and HbR.

Motion artifacts were mitigated using the temporal derivative distribution repair (TDDR) (Fishburn et al. 2019)  motion correction method. Automatic identification and removal of spikes were performed, with variations over 3.5 in OD throughout a time lag of 5 seconds corrected using a monotonic interpolation. A General Linear Model (GLM) based short-channel regression (SSR) was performed for each channel, using all available short distance channels as a regressor.A Butterworth 2nd-order high pass filter and a gaussian smoothing low pass filter, with cut-off frequencies of 0.03 – 0.4 Hz respectively, were applied to remove low-frequency drifts as well as part of non-hemodynamic related signal components such as heart rate. Data were then converted to variations of concentration of oxy- and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbO and HbR) using the modified Beer-Lambert Law, incorporating a differential path length factor (DPF) of 6.40 and 5.75 for each wavelength and a z-transform normalization was performed. 

Channel-of-interest selection
We selected 3 channels for each hemisphere that represented the hand knob area in the primary motor cortex, based on Satori’s visualization of channels’ projection of light on a 3D head mesh. Note that this is light projection not based on Montecarlo simulations, but only used for guiding optode location in reference to the brain model. For the left2s and left3s condition, we used channel S10-D24, S10-D25 and S11-D24. For the right2s and right3s condition, we used channel S3-D8, S3-D9 and S4-D8.

Individual-level analysis
For each participant 6 separate general linear model (GLM)s were performed to investigate the hypotheses. As contrast 1 – 4 used only one run, we performed a serial correlations correction using an iterative least squares method with a maximum AR(p) order factor of 20s with a maximum of 20 iterations.

List of contrasts:
1.     Left2s vs. rest.
2.     Right2s vs. rest.
3.     Left3s vs. rest.
4.     Right3s vs. rest.
5.     Left3s > left2s.
6.     Right3s > right2s.

Hypothesis testing 

Hypothesis 1
We interpreted hypothesis 1 as: Left-hand 2-s finger tapping evokes a response in contralateral M1. So we tested: (Left2sec > Baseline).

Hypothesis 2
We interpreted hypothesis 2 as: Both left- and right-hand 2-s finger tapping evoke a response in contralateral M1. So we tested: (Left2sec > Baseline) ; (Right2sec > Baseline).

Hypothesis 3
We interpreted hypothesis 3 as: Both left- and right-hand finger tapping (independent of duration) evoke a response in contralateral M1. So we tested: (Left2sec > baseline) AND (Left3sec > baseline) ; (Right2sec > baseline) AND (Right3sec > baseline).

Hypothesis 4
We interpreted hypothesis 4 as: 3-s finger tapping (independent of hand condition) evokes a greater response in contralateral M1 than 2-s finger tapping. So we tested: (Left3sec > Left2sec) ; (Right3sec > Right2sec).

To answer the hypotheses, we performed five GLM contrasts for each individual participant:
1.     Left2s vs. rest
2.     Right2s vs. rest
3.     Left3s vs. rest
4.     Right3s vs. rest
5.     Left3s > left2s
6.     Right3s > right2s

Hypothesis 1 needed contrast 1 (left 2s vs. rest).
Hypothesis 2 needed contrast 1 and 2 (left 2s vs. rest AND right 2s vs. rest).
Hypothesis 3 needed contrast 1, 2, 3 and 4 (left 2s vs. rest AND right 2s vs. rest AND left 3s vs. rest AND right 3s vs. rest).
Hypothesis 4 needed contrast 5 and 6 (left3s > left2 AND right3s > right2s).

A hypothesis was considered true if for all the relevant contrasts any of the three channels of interest had a p-value < 0.1 (one-sided). This had to be the case for both oxygenated- and deoxygenated hemoglobin.



Exploratory group analysis
For the exploratory analysis we formulated the following hypothesis: Right- and left-hemispheric M1 is differently engaged in left- and right-hand finger tapping.

We tested this as the following contrast for a random effects (RXF) GLM: (Left 3sec + Left 2 sec) > (Right 3sec + Right 2sec).

Channel of Interest selection
Aligning 3D probe positions based on landmark positions present in the probe information in each ‘snirf’ file, allowed for the correspondence of optode location to normalized MNI space. Using term-based meta-analyses on fMRI data (https://neurosynth.org/) and a public repository of fMRI based-data statistical maps (Gorgolewski et al. 2015), a selection of channels of interest, corresponding to the brain regions mentioned in the hypothesis tested was done.

Finally, all channels comprised of the combination of optodes S7-10 and D6-8 were considered to cover the occipital cortex.

Group-level analysis
A random effects (RFX-GLM) group-level analysis was performed, separating subject predictors of the experimental protocol (‘Control’, ‘Noise,’ ‘Speach’), to determine active cortical areas considering the contrasts for each hypothesis testing (N = 13, p < 0.05 uncorrected).

Hypothesis testing and Results Reporting
For each hypothesis, we report the statistical t-value from the group-level RFX-GLM contrast analysis, as well as the p-value, for each of the channels of interest active (if any), for both HbO and HbR. For all hypotheses, we considered it true if any channel within the channels of interest aforementioned described for the respective brain region appears to have a significant activation for both HbO and HbR.

Preprocessing
fNIRS data preprocessing and analysis was performed using Satori 1.8.2 (Brain Innovation, the Netherlands (Lührs and Goebel 2017). Raw data trimming was performed for all functional runs, cutting 5 seconds before the onset of the first experimental condition and 15 seconds after the offset of the last experimental condition. Raw intensity signals were converted to changes in optical density calculated from the normalized changes in light intensity incident in the detector from its paired source position. Motion artifacts were mitigated using the temporal derivative distribution repair (TDDR) (Fishburn et al. 2019)  motion correction method. Automatic identification and removal of spikes were performed, with variations over 3.5 in OD throughout a time lag of 5 seconds corrected using a monotonic interpolation. A General Linear Model (GLM) based short-channel regression (SSR) was performed for each channel, using all available short distance channels as a regressor.A Butterworth 2nd-order high pass filter and a gaussian smoothing low pass filter, with cut-off frequencies of 0.03 – 0.4 Hz respectively, were applied to remove low-frequency drifts as well as part of non-hemodynamic related signal components such as heart rate. Data were then converted to variations of concentration of oxy- and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbO and HbR) using the modified Beer-Lambert Law, incorporating a differential path length factor (DPF) of 6.40 and 5.75 for each wavelength and a z-transform normalization was performed. 

Channel-of-interest selection
We selected 3 channels for each hemisphere that represented the hand knob area in the primary motor cortex, based on Satori’s visualization of channels’ projection of light on a 3D head mesh. Note that this is light projection not based on Montecarlo simulations, but only used for guiding optode location in reference to the brain model. For the left2s and left3s condition, we used channel S10-D24, S10-D25 and S11-D24. For the right2s and right3s condition, we used channel S3-D8, S3-D9 and S4-D8.

Individual-level analysis
For each participant 6 separate general linear model (GLM)s were performed to investigate the hypotheses. As contrast 1 – 4 used only one run, we performed a serial correlations correction using an iterative least squares method with a maximum AR(p) order factor of 20s with a maximum of 20 iterations.

List of contrasts:
1.     Left2s vs. rest.
2.     Right2s vs. rest.
3.     Left3s vs. rest.
4.     Right3s vs. rest.
5.     Left3s > left2s.
6.     Right3s > right2s.

Hypothesis testing 

Hypothesis 1
We interpreted hypothesis 1 as: Left-hand 2-s finger tapping evokes a response in contralateral M1. So we tested: (Left2sec > Baseline).

Hypothesis 2
We interpreted hypothesis 2 as: Both left- and right-hand 2-s finger tapping evoke a response in contralateral M1. So we tested: (Left2sec > Baseline) ; (Right2sec > Baseline).

Hypothesis 3
We interpreted hypothesis 3 as: Both left- and right-hand finger tapping (independent of duration) evoke a response in contralateral M1. So we tested: (Left2sec > baseline) AND (Left3sec > baseline) ; (Right2sec > baseline) AND (Right3sec > baseline).

Hypothesis 4
We interpreted hypothesis 4 as: 3-s finger tapping (independent of hand condition) evokes a greater response in contralateral M1 than 2-s finger tapping. So we tested: (Left3sec > Left2sec) ; (Right3sec > Right2sec).

To answer the hypotheses, we performed five GLM contrasts for each individual participant:
1.     Left2s vs. rest
2.     Right2s vs. rest
3.     Left3s vs. rest
4.     Right3s vs. rest
5.     Left3s > left2s
6.     Right3s > right2s

Hypothesis 1 needed contrast 1 (left 2s vs. rest).
Hypothesis 2 needed contrast 1 and 2 (left 2s vs. rest AND right 2s vs. rest).
Hypothesis 3 needed contrast 1, 2, 3 and 4 (left 2s vs. rest AND right 2s vs. rest AND left 3s vs. rest AND right 3s vs. rest).
Hypothesis 4 needed contrast 5 and 6 (left3s > left2 AND right3s > right2s).

A hypothesis was considered true if for all the relevant contrasts any of the three channels of interest had a p-value < 0.1 (one-sided). This had to be the case for both oxygenated- and deoxygenated hemoglobin.



Exploratory group analysis
For the exploratory analysis we formulated the following hypothesis: Right- and left-hemispheric M1 is differently engaged in left- and right-hand finger tapping.

We tested this as the following contrast for a random effects (RXF) GLM: (Left 3sec + Left 2 sec) > (Right 3sec + Right 2sec).

fNIRS data was preprocessed using the Homer3 toolbox (https://github.com/BUNPC/Homer3, v.1.58.0) using in identical protocol for both datasets. A detailed description of the functions and parameters can be found in Figure 1. First, light intensity data were converted to optical density. Then motion artifacts were reduced by applying first a spline int	ation (Molavi & Dumont, 2012), following the recommendations of Novi et al. (2020) for speech studies. fNIRS data were filtered using a bandpass filter between 0.01 and 0.5 Hz to reduce interference from physiological sources such as heart rate (Yücel et al., 2021). To convert optical density into concentration data in ?M mm, we used the modified Beer-Lambert law (Maki et al., 1995). Finally, the hemodynamic response function (HRF) over trial/runs for each session was estimated by using the GLM function from Homer3, whereby short-separation measurements were used to remove fluctuations in the extracerebral blood flow so the brain activation signals could be located with higher accuracy (Gagnon et al., 2011; Yücel et al., 2015). The resulting estimate of the HRF timeseries was then averaged across condition blocks for each session/condition, and respective standard deviations were calculated (using Homer provided functions) Average concentration and associated SDs were exported for further analysis in R. 
Mean HRF values were calculated for each session/condition for the expected peak of the HRF (peak window: 4-10 sec post stimulus), SDs were converted into standard error of means based on the number of available trials that were used for the estimation of the respective HRF response in Homer. 
Prior to the analyses, bad channels were identified based on a combination of outlier identification and manual visual inspection of the channels. Several measurement channels were identified as noisy and excluded, resulting in reduced sample sizes for channels 
";"preprocessing similar to study 1.
Here the full timecourses were used for inference, and no averages across baseline/peak windows.
average concentration timecourses were analysed with respect to the baseline period and Within the peak window of the HRF (t<10s), the number of bins were determined where the lower bound of standard errors was larger than the upper bound of the respective mean baseline standard error suggesting reliable concentration larger than zero.
Furthermore, the bins were determined where the upper bound of the respective mean baseline standard error of HbR was lower than the lower bound of standard errors of HbO.
If both conditions were fulfilled for at least x bins, a channel was deemed as reliable activated for a specific condition within a subject. 
Then, those channels were listed that exceeded both of theses thresholds for at least 10 bins (~.5 sec). This bin threshold was determined by manual inspection of HRF forms and distribution of bin lengths across the whole dataset, both HRF forms (typical HRF forms were observed in the data with these thresholds) and the distribution (a visible cut at 10) supported the choice. A subject was considered to have reliable contralateral activation, if at least one channel around the sources 5,3,10,12 was reliable activated.

Hypothesis 4
Using a similar strategy as above (distance between HRF with respect to upper/lower bound of SEM in reliably activated channels) did not yield any results.
Thus, a different strategy was performed:
WIlcoxon Tests were performed across a window of 2-10 sec for the the HRF timeseries data of condition 3s versus condition 2s

fNIRS data was preprocessed using the Homer3 toolbox (https://github.com/BUNPC/Homer3, v.1.58.0) using in identical protocol for both datasets. A detailed description of the functions and parameters can be found in Figure 1. First, light intensity data were converted to optical density. Then motion artifacts were reduced by applying first a spline int	ation (Molavi & Dumont, 2012), following the recommendations of Novi et al. (2020) for speech studies. fNIRS data were filtered using a bandpass filter between 0.01 and 0.5 Hz to reduce interference from physiological sources such as heart rate (Yücel et al., 2021). To convert optical density into concentration data in ?M mm, we used the modified Beer-Lambert law (Maki et al., 1995). Finally, the hemodynamic response function (HRF) over trial/runs for each session was estimated by using the GLM function from Homer3, whereby short-separation measurements were used to remove fluctuations in the extracerebral blood flow so the brain activation signals could be located with higher accuracy (Gagnon et al., 2011; Yücel et al., 2015). The resulting estimate of the HRF timeseries was then averaged across condition blocks for each session/condition, and respective standard deviations were calculated (using Homer provided functions) Average concentration and associated SDs were exported for further analysis in R. 
Mean HRF values were calculated for each session/condition for the expected peak of the HRF (peak window: 4-10 sec post stimulus), SDs were converted into standard error of means based on the number of available trials that were used for the estimation of the respective HRF response in Homer. 
Prior to the analyses, bad channels were identified based on a combination of outlier identification and manual visual inspection of the channels. Several measurement channels were identified as noisy and excluded, resulting in reduced sample sizes for channels 
";"preprocessing similar to study 1.
Here the full timecourses were used for inference, and no averages across baseline/peak windows.
average concentration timecourses were analysed with respect to the baseline period and Within the peak window of the HRF (t<10s), the number of bins were determined where the lower bound of standard errors was larger than the upper bound of the respective mean baseline standard error suggesting reliable concentration larger than zero.
Furthermore, the bins were determined where the upper bound of the respective mean baseline standard error of HbR was lower than the lower bound of standard errors of HbO.
If both conditions were fulfilled for at least x bins, a channel was deemed as reliable activated for a specific condition within a subject. 
Then, those channels were listed that exceeded both of theses thresholds for at least 10 bins (~.5 sec). This bin threshold was determined by manual inspection of HRF forms and distribution of bin lengths across the whole dataset, both HRF forms (typical HRF forms were observed in the data with these thresholds) and the distribution (a visible cut at 10) supported the choice. A subject was considered to have reliable contralateral activation, if at least one channel around the sources 5,3,10,12 was reliable activated.

Hypothesis 4
Using a similar strategy as above (distance between HRF with respect to upper/lower bound of SEM in reliably activated channels) did not yield any results.
Thus, a different strategy was performed:
WIlcoxon Tests were performed across a window of 2-10 sec for the the HRF timeseries data of condition 3s versus condition 2s
The following results were obtained at an uncorrected p-value of <.05
and showed a mixtur of larger response for 2s or 3s, but no clear pattern.

The pipeline for individual subject level included 1- enPruneChannels with range thresholds of [1e04, 1e07] and SNR threshold of 2; 2- targetPCA motion correction on converted optical density data (STDEVthresh = 5 and AMPthresh = 2). I performed manual inspection on the correction results and excluded trials from 20s before remaining artifacts to 20s after the artifacts; 3- temporal filtering on optical density timecourses with cutoff frequencies of 0.01Hz to 0.5Hz; 4- after transforming optical density to hemoglobin, I extracted the HRF to each type of tasks from 2s before the onset to 15s after the onset using GLM (basis functions = Gaussian, paramsBasis = [1 1]). I included short channel data that had the highest correlation as a regressor. Only the HbO response function was used in the following analysis.

Based on the spatial locations of the NIRS channels (viewed through AtlasViewer), I selected Region of Interests (ROIs) that covered the left HG (Ch 8 and 11), the right HG (Ch 29 and 32), the IFG (Ch 1,4,6) and the occipital lobe (Ch 16,17,19,20,21,23,24), and averaged their HRFs as the ROI response. To obtain a metric of response level, I established a linear model to calculate the beta value of the ROI response relative to an expected response (obtained through the convolution of task timing with an SPM8 canonical HRF). The beta values of each task, each ROI, and each subject are used in the group level statistical analysis.

To test hypothesis 1, I conducted one sample t-test on the beta values of the left HG response to speech to test whether the beta values were significantly different from zero. To test hypothesis 2, I conducted one-tailed, paired t-test (Speech > Noise) to test whether the beta values of the response to speech were significantly larger than those to noise. To test hypothesis 3, I conducted one-tailed, paired t-test (Left HG > right HG) to test whether the beta values of the response to speech were significantly larger in the left HG than in the right HG. To test hypothesis 4, I conducted a one sample t-test to test the beta values of the left IFG ROI on whether they are significantly different from zero. To test hypothesis 5, I conducted a one-tailed, paired t-test (Speech > Noise) to test whether the beta values associated with Speech were significantly larger than those with Noise in the left IFG. To test hypotheses 6 and 7 respectively, I conducted one-sample t-tests to test whether the beta values of the occipital lobe response to speech and silence were significantly different from zero.";"I used homer2 toolbox for this study. The data pre-processing steps and the GLM model were the same as in the previous Auditory study. I selected ROIs corresponding to the left M1 (Ch 10,15,21) and the right M1 (Ch 44,49,55) according to the spatial locations of the channels.

To assess the statistical significance at individual subject level, I extract the response to each finger tapping trial by averaging the HbO changes of all channels within an ROI from 2 seconds before each trial to 15 seconds after the trial onset. I calculated the beta values by regressing the ROI response function to an expected response function obtained by the convolution of task timing and a SPM8 canonical HRF.

For each subject in hypothesis 1, I conducted one-sample t-tests on the beta values of right M1 ROI to see whether they were significantly different from zero. I treated each subject as an individual test so I did not perform any multicomparison correction on the obtained p-values. To test hypothesis 2, I combined the beta values of the right M1 ROI (in left 2s finger tapping) and the values of the left M1 ROI (in right 2s finger tapping) for each subject, and conducted one-sample t-tests on the beta values. To test hypothesis 3, I combined the beta values of the right M1 ROI (in left 2s and 3s finger tapping) and the values of the left M1 ROI (in right 2s and 3s finger tapping) for each subject and performed one-sample t-tests on the beta values. To test hypothesis 4, I combined the beta values of the left and right M1 ROIs (in right 2s and left 2s finger tapping respectively) and the values of the left and right M1 ROIs (in right 3s and left 3s finger tapping), and conducted one-tailed (3s > 2s), two sample t-test for each subject. Again, no correction on the p-values was performed as each subject was treated independently.";;;;;"I first divided the dataset into 2s and 3s finger tapping. 

For each subject, I used the extracted HRF of HbO concentration to each task (dcAvg) from the GLM model and calculated a beta value by regressing the HbO HRF to an expected response constructed by convolving the task timing and a SPM8 canonical HRF. I performed two-tailed, paired t-tests at each regular fNIRS channel to test the hypothesis and the beta values of the response to left and right finger tapping were not statistically significant. 

For 2s finger tapping, I rejected the null hypothesis at alpha = 0.05 at one channel (ch 25, p = 0.0424), which corresponded to the lateral portion of the left precentral cortex. For 3s finger tapping, I rejected the null hypothesis at alpha = 0.05 at three channels (Ch 5, p = 0.0115, Ch 17, p = 0.464, and Ch 29, p = 0.0363). And there were some adjacent channels that were marginally significant (e.g. Ch 6, p = 0.0544, Ch 4, p = 0.0614). Ch 5 was located in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Ch 17 was located in the left postcentral gyrus and Ch 29 was located in the left angular gyrus. 

However, none of the above channels remained significant after I performed false discovery rate corrections on the channel-wise p-values. I therefore conclude that I was not able to find any brain region that showed a statistically significant difference in response to left and to right finger tapping.";;;1;HOMER2;Visual Inspection of Time Domain,SNR Threshold,Manual Selection;Combo;;SNR_thresh = 2, dRange = [1e+04 1e+07];;;;32;Targeted PCA;Targeted PCA;Correction;;STDEVthresh = 5, AMPthres = 2;;;;;LowPass,HighPass;BP;"f_hp = 0.01; f_lp = 0.5";"filter_type = butter; lp_filter_order = 3; hp_filter_order = 5;";checked;OD;No;DPF = [6 6];GLM;GLM;;OLS (Ordinary Least Squares);;;Consecutive Gaussian;"gaus_width = 1; gaus_step = 1;";Polynomial Drift,Short Channels;;Matlab;One-Sample t-Test,One-tailed t-test,Paired t-Test,Two-tailed t-test,Two-Sample t-Test,Multiple Comparisons Correction;HbO only;ROI;;;Based on the spatial locations of channels;beta values provided by GLM;Kolmogorov–Smirnov;;;0.05;FDR;;;;;4;4;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I performed two-tailed, paired t-tests at each regular fNIRS channel to test the hypothesis and the beta values of the response to left and right finger tapping were not statistically significant. 

For 2s finger tapping, I rejected the null hypothesis at alpha = 0.05 at one channel (ch 25, p = 0.0424), which corresponded to the lateral portion of the left precentral cortex. For 3s finger tapping, I rejected the null hypothesis at alpha = 0.05 at three channels (Ch 5, p = 0.0115, Ch 17, p = 0.464, and Ch 29, p = 0.0363). And there were some adjacent channels that were marginally significant (e.g. Ch 6, p = 0.0544, Ch 4, p = 0.0614). Ch 5 was located in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Ch 17 was located in the left postcentral gyrus and Ch 29 was located in the left angular gyrus. 

However, none of the above channels remained significant after I performed false discovery rate corrections on the channel-wise p-values. I therefore conclude that I was not able to find any brain region that showed a statistically significant difference in response to left and to right finger tapping.";;;2;HOMER2;Visual Inspection of Time Domain,SNR Threshold,Manual Selection;Combo;;SNR_thresh = 2, dRange = [1e+04 1e+07];;;;32;Targeted PCA;Targeted PCA;Correction;;STDEVthresh = 5, AMPthres = 2;;;;;LowPass,HighPass;BP;"f_hp = 0.01; f_lp = 0.5";"filter_type = butter; lp_filter_order = 3; hp_filter_order = 5;";checked;OD;No;DPF = [6 6];GLM;GLM;;OLS (Ordinary Least Squares);;;Consecutive Gaussian;"gaus_width = 1; gaus_step = 1;";Polynomial Drift,Short Channels;;Matlab;One-Sample t-Test,One-tailed t-test,Paired t-Test,Two-tailed t-test,Two-Sample t-Test,Multiple Comparisons Correction;HbO only;ROI;;;Based on the spatial locations of channels;beta values provided by GLM;Kolmogorov–Smirnov;;;0.05;FDR;;;;;4;4;;;;;;;;;;;;;;TRUE;TRUE;TRUE;TRUE;N/A;N/A;N/A

Study 1;25;Yes;15;"The value above denotes the p-value for left HG (after running joint test in NIRS-TOOLBOX), which is covered by Source 6 and Detector 2. For group analysis, our analysis pipeline includes loading the raw data, perform channel pruning with QT-NIRS (Scalp Coupling Index set to 0.7, q threshold set to 0.7 and PSP set to 0.7). QT-NIRS does the quality assessment by detecting the cardiac pulsation in the signal all the details are described in the analysis section. After channel pruning was done and bad channels were excluded, we performed the standard pipeline , OD conversion and MBLL for OD to Hb and then subject-level GLM (AR-IRLS). After obtaining the subject-level statistics, we ran a mixed effect model the formula used for the model is:

formula = 'beta ~ -1 + cond + (1|subject)'

We got the statistics at the group level. For S6-D2 and the ‘Speech’ condition, p values were 0.0001 and 0.0006 for HbO and HbR, respectively. We decided to perform a joint test (using NIRS-TOOLBOX jointTest function) which gave us the F, p, q, DF1, and DF2 values for each condition (speech, noise, silence or control) and each source-detector pair. From the joint test, p-value (left HG) < 0.001 also indicates a statistically significant response in left HG.
";No;7378;"The processing analysis is the same as Hypothesis 1 till running the mixed effect model. To test the second hypothesis, we ran a contrast between speech and noise conditions ('Spech-Noise') for the Left HG. After running the contrast, statistics It can be seen that the beta (HbO)= 0.7862 and beta (HbR) = -0.1245  for this region are relatively low. The p-value(HbO)= 0.07378 and p-value (HbR) = 0.48034 for both the chromophores are not statistically significant too for ‘Speech-Noise’. We also performed the joint test which combines the HbO and HbR at the statistical level and gives an F-statistics-based joint result. For the 'Speech-Noise' contrast the joint test showed an F value of 1.7232 (p= 0.1871) establishing the fact that speech stimuli didn't evoke a statistically larger response than noise. Hypothesis 2 was not satisfied.
";No;1459;"For testing hypothesis 3, using the beta values for 'Speech' condition obtained from the subject-level analysis, a paired t-test between left Heschl’s Gyrus (S6-D2) and Right Heschl’s Gyrus (S11-D12) was performed for both the chromophores HbO and HbR. For the HbO, the null hypothesis wasn’t rejected (h=0, p=0.1459), which indicates no significant difference between LHG and RHG for the speech stimuli. For HbR null hypothesis couldn’t be rejected too (h=0, p=0.5435). The response for both the chromophores in the LHG and RHG resulted in accepting the null hypothesis that there was no statistical difference between left HG and right HG for Speech. It could be concluded that the left HG didn't evoke a larger response than the right HG.
";No;61255;Source 6 Detector 5 covers the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG). After getting the group-level result for LIFG p-value(HbO)= 0.6125 and p-value(HbR)= 0.4893, where the results indicated that there was no significant response in the LIFG for Speech stimuli. The p-value after the joint test is 0.653625, which also means there wasn’t any significant activation in that area. Hypothesis 4 was not satisfied.;No;8985;After running the contrast 'Speech-Noise', for the S6-D5 pair (covers LIFG) it was seen that the p values [p-value (hbo)= 0.89853 and p-value (HbR) = 0.64731 ] for both the chromophores are not statistically significant. The joint test provided a p-value of 0.8755 for LIFG that also denotes that 'Speech' didn’t have any statistically larger effect than 'Noise' stimuli. Hypothesis 5 was not satisfied.;No;90898;For Hypothesis 6, as the occipital cortex was indicated in the hypothesis Region of Interest (ROI) based analysis was done. A total of 7 channels (S7-D6, S7-D7, S8-D6, S8-D7, S8-D8, S10-D7, S10-D8) were selected for ROI analysis. For the 'Speech' condition in occipital region, p-value of (HbO) = 0.003 and p-value (HbR) = 0.1747 were obtained. We didn't want to draw conclusion based on only the HbO. We ran a joint test for the ROI analysis result. The joint test showed a p-value of 0.090898 for speech stimuli in the occipital region, which means there wasn't any significant response in the occipital cortex for 'Speech' stimuli. So, Hypothesis 6 wasn’t satisfied. Alongside the ROI analysis, only a single channel (S10-D7) evoked some response (p-value of 0.0030902). This can be a false activation, maybe originating from the skin or scalp. We didn't perform any short-channel regression.;No;749913;Based on ROI analysis for the silence condition corresponding p-values for HbO and Hbr were 0.565 and 0.517, respectively. The joint test yielded a p-value of 0.749913 for the 'Silence' condition, which isn’t statistically significant too. So, it can be stated that the noise stimuli didn’t evoke any response in the occipital region. We observed single-channel activation results also, but for the 'Silence' condition, there weren’t any responses in the channels which covered the occipital region either. Thus it can be concluded that Hypothesis 7 wasn't satisfied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"All the analysis were carried out in NIRS-Toolbox.

Individual Analysis:
The individual analysis began with loading the raw data with the loadBIDS function. Quality assessment was done with QT-NIRS with the parameters following:

qThreshold = 0.70; % Require at least 70% of good data in every channel
sciThreshold = 0.70; % Lowering threshold means less strict
pspThreshold = 0.1; %Peak power threshold
% Data to be considered: ""all"" only the conditions | ""resting"" the whole timeseries
condMask = 'all'; %Only the conditions
fCut = [0.5 2.5]; %Cutoff Frequency
windowSec = 5; % Consider 5-sec windows

After running the channel pruning channels which didn't fulfill the criteria stated above were considered bad channel and excluded. The rest of the analysis was carried out with only the channels which survived channel pruning. The rest procedure follwos standard pipeline : Conversion to OD, OD to Hb space by MBLL and lastly the GLM(AR-IRLS) analysis at subject level.

This individual standard pipeline which is applicable to all the hypothesis and participants.

Group Level Analysis:  
The group level analysis began with mixed effect model with the formula below:

formula = 'beta ~ -1 + cond + (1|subject)'

>>> For Hypothesis 1 and 4, the Group Statistics result was used to test the hypothesis and draw conclusion.

>>> Contrast {'Speech-Noise'} based analysis was carried out on the group result for Hypothesis 2 and 5.

>>> After obtaining the Subject Statistics paired t-test was carried out for Hypothesis 3 to show if the response was higher in left HG than right HG.

>>> ROI based analysis was carried out for Hypothesis 6 and 7.

>>> All the values such as beta, p and F were derived for HbO, HbR and Joint. The analysis was done considering all these 3 types on group results. ";"All the analysis were carried out in NIRS-Toolbox.

Individual Analysis:
The individual analysis began with loading the raw data with the loadBIDS function. Quality assessment was done with QT-NIRS with the following parameters:

qThreshold = 0.70; % Require at least 70% of good data in every channel

fCut = [0.5 2.5]; %Cutoff Frequency
windowSec = 5; % Consider 5-sec windows

After running the channel pruning, channels which didn't fulfill the criteria stated above were considered bad channels and excluded from the study. The rest of the analysis was carried out with only the channels which survived channel pruning. The rest procedure was standard pipeline: Conversion to OD, OD to Hb space by MBLL and lastly, the GLM(AR-IRLS) analysis at the subject level.

This individual standard pipeline is applicable to all the hypotheses and participants.

For all the hypotheses, left and right motor cortexes were defined using the ROI and the rest of the analysis are based on ROI.  We faced some problems while running the ROI average function from NIRS-Toolbox. This gave us the 'NaN' for the F, p, and q statistics. This happened due to the channel pruning. So we had to nullify the channels and dependent data with 'NaN'.  For Subject 6 sessions Right 2 sec and Right 3 sec and for Subject 8, Left 2 sec session were excluded as they didn't have any good channel in the defined region of interest. 

Hypothesis 1 was tested by checking the q-values for all the subjects except subject 8. Those participants yielding a q-value less than 0.05 were considered to satisfy Hypothesis 1.

Hypothesis 2 stated that Left 2 sec and Right 2 sec, conditions combined, evoked a response in the contralateral motor cortex. We first checked the q values for left-hand finger tapping (ROI = right motor cortex) and right hand finger tapping ( ROI= left motor cortex) and combined these two conditions with an 'AND' (&&) operator in MATLAB to do the hypothesis testing. If both the q values were statistically significant then the hypothesis was considered true for that subject. This is applicable to all the subjects except Subject 6 and 8, as they were missing the session after channel pruning due to not having any good channel in the defined ROI.

In summary:

if (q-value(left 2 sec 'ROI=Right Motor Cortex')< 0.05 && q-value(right 2 sec 'ROI = Left Motor Cortex')< 0.05):
         Hypothesis 2 Satisfied

Hypothesis 3, It was told to combine Left and Right 2 sec and 3 sec conditions. All four conditions (q-value of particular response and it's relevant ROI) were connected with 'AND' (&&) operator to do the hypothesis check. If all of them were less than 0.05 then the Hypothesis was considered true for that particular subject. This is applicable to all the subjects except Subject 6 and 8, as they were missing the session after channel pruning due to not having any good channel in the defined ROI.

Hypothesis 4 was done by adding the statistically significant (q<0.05) F values for the left and right 2 sec condition and comparing them against the statistically significant (q<0.05) added F values for left and right 3 sec condition. If the added F value was greater for left and right 3 sec than left and right 2 sec then that hypothesis was considered true for that particular individual.

In short summary:

if (q for all the conditions <0.05) then

    If (F value (left 3 sec) +F value (right 3 sec)) > (F value (left 2 sec) + F value (right 2 sec))

     Then Hypothesis 4 satisfied";For testing hypothesis 1 we utilized the q-values for each conditions.

We used Nirs-Toolbox to perform most of our analysis, which to our best knowledge, doesn't support spatial contrast right this moment.

Individual Analysis:
The individual analysis began with loading the raw data with the loadBIDS function. Quality assessment was done with QT-NIRS with the parameters following:

qThreshold = 0.70; % Require at least 70% of good data in every channel
sciThreshold = 0.70; % Lowering threshold means less strict
pspThreshold = 0.1; %Peak power threshold
% Data to be considered: ""all"" only the conditions | ""resting"" the whole timeseries
condMask = 'all'; %Only the conditions
fCut = [0.5 2.5]; %Cutoff Frequency
windowSec = 5; % Consider 5-sec windows

After running the channel pruning channels which didn't fulfill the criteria stated above were considered bad channel and excluded. The rest of the analysis was carried out with only the channels which survived channel pruning. The rest procedure follwos standard pipeline : Conversion to OD, OD to Hb space by MBLL and lastly the GLM(AR-IRLS) analysis at subject level.

This individual standard pipeline which is applicable to all the hypothesis and participants.

Group Level Analysis:  
The group level analysis began with mixed effect model with the formula below:

formula = 'beta ~ -1 + cond + (1|subject)'

>>> For Hypothesis 1 and 4, the Group Statistics result was used to test the hypothesis and draw conclusion.

>>> Contrast {'Speech-Noise'} based analysis was carried out on the group result for Hypothesis 2 and 5.

>>> After obtaining the Subject Statistics paired t-test was carried out for Hypothesis 3 to show if the response was higher in left HG than right HG.

>>> ROI based analysis was carried out for Hypothesis 6 and 7.

>>> All the values such as beta, p and F were derived for HbO, HbR and Joint. The analysis was done considering all these 3 types on group results. ";"All the analysis were carried out in NIRS-Toolbox.

The rest of the analysis was carried out with only the channels which survived channel pruning. The rest procedure was standard pipeline: Conversion to OD, OD to Hb space by MBLL and lastly, the GLM(AR-IRLS) analysis at the subject level.

This individual standard pipeline is applicable to all the hypotheses and participants.

For all the hypotheses, left and right motor cortexes were defined using the ROI and the rest of the analysis are based on ROI.  We faced some problems while running the ROI average function from NIRS-Toolbox. This gave us the 'NaN' for the F, p, and q statistics. This happened due to the channel pruning. So we had to nullify the channels and dependent data with 'NaN'.  For Subject 6 sessions Right 2 sec and Right 3 sec and for Subject 8, Left 2 sec session were excluded as they didn't have any good channel in the defined region of interest. 

Hypothesis 1 was tested by checking the q-values for all the subjects except subject 8. Those participants yielding a q-value less than 0.05 were considered to satisfy Hypothesis 1.

Hypothesis 2 stated that Left 2 sec and Right 2 sec, conditions combined, evoked a response in the contralateral motor cortex. We first checked the q values for left-hand finger tapping (ROI = right motor cortex) and right hand finger tapping ( ROI= left motor cortex) and combined these two conditions with an 'AND' (&&) operator in MATLAB to do the hypothesis testing. If both the q values were statistically significant then the hypothesis was considered true for that subject. This is applicable to all the subjects except Subject 6 and 8, as they were missing the session after channel pruning due to not having any good channel in the defined ROI.

In summary:

if (q-value(left 2 sec 'ROI=Right Motor Cortex')< 0.05 && q-value(right 2 sec 'ROI = Left Motor Cortex')< 0.05):
         Hypothesis 2 Satisfied

Hypothesis 3, It was told to combine Left and Right 2 sec and 3 sec conditions. All four conditions (q-value of particular response and it's relevant ROI) were connected with 'AND' (&&) operator to do the hypothesis check. If all of them were less than 0.05 then the Hypothesis was considered true for that particular subject. This is applicable to all the subjects except Subject 6 and 8, as they were missing the session after channel pruning due to not having any good channel in the defined ROI.

Hypothesis 4 was done by adding the statistically significant (q<0.05) F values for the left and right 2 sec condition and comparing them against the statistically significant (q<0.05) added F values for left and right 3 sec condition. If the added F value was greater for left and right 3 sec than left and right 2 sec then that hypothesis was considered true for that particular individual.

In short summary:

if (q for all the conditions <0.05) then

    If (F value (left 3 sec) +F value (right 3 sec)) > (F value (left 2 sec) + F value (right 2 sec))

     Then Hypothesis 4 satisfied";For testing hypothesis 1 we utilized the q-values for each conditions.

1. The quality of the channels was assessed using the enPruneChannels function. Please note that bad channels were not excluded from the analysis until the second level analysis. 
2. Data was then converted to optical density.  
3. Next, the data was corrected for motion artifacts using a hybrid motion correction approach outlined by Novi et al, Neurophotonics, 2020. This approach utilizes spline interpolation followed by wavelet correction. The following functions adapted from Homer2 (MotionCorrectionMARA and hmrMotionCorrectWavelet) were used.  
4. The motion corrected timeseries were then converted to oxy and deoxyhemoglobin using the Modified Beer-Lambert law with a differential pathlength factor of six for all participants. Please note the differential pathlength factor would typically be corrected based on the participants age, however, this information was unknown (for obvious reasons) for this data set. The function used was hmrOD2Conc.  
5. The hemoglobin time series were then filtered using a low pass filter with a third order filter with a cut-off of 0.5 Hz (Homer2 function: hmrBandpassFilt). The signals were then detrended to remove any slow drifts using the detrend function in MATLAB 
6. Finally, GLM with prewhitening was used to infer the presence of brain activity with short channels being added as regressors of nuisance in the model. Only good quality short channels were included. A short channel was deemed good quality if there was a clear cardiac peak in the power spectrum. Short channel regression was performed based on Santosa and colleagues, Neurophotonics, 2020. Therefore, oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin signals for each good quality short channel were included as regressors, with PCA (as implemented using the MATLAB function pca) being applied to remove collinearity. 
7. Second level analysis was performed using a weighted linear regression approach. A channel was considered activated if there was significant activity (p < .05) in both oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. The ordering of the conditions in the contrast vector was control, noise, speech.

Data ingestion and first level analysis were performed in Python, using customized versions of the ""mne-nirs"" and ""nilearn"" packages. Parameters are provided in a separate json file, including partial path length factor, HRF basis function, as well as parameters for filtering the signal and ROI calculation. 
 
1. Since digitizer data were identical for each data set, channel specificity was precomputed for channels with a distance between 15 and 45mm based on the Juelich atlas and the channel mapping of the fOLD toolbox. Only channels with a specificity greater than 30 were considered as relevant and included in an ROI.
2. We converted the raw fNIRS signal to optical density. 
3. We performed a bad channel detection and excluded bad channels from the analysis.
4. To reduce motion artifacts, we applied the Temporal Derivative Distribution Repair (Fishburn et al., 2019) to optical density.
5. Haemoglobin was calculated using a partial path length factor of 0.1. 
6. A bandpass filter using frequency bounds (0.01 Hz, 0.7 Hz) and transitions (0.005, 0.3) was applied.
7. Short and long-distance channels were separated based on the optode distance (short: d < 15mm, long: 15mm<=d <= 45mm).
8. Response estimates, denoted by theta, per channel and condition (e.g., noise, speech, etc.) were derived via GLM. The GLM fitted an HRF basis function (Glover) based on the long channels and used short channels to regress out physiological noise. The session-specific stimuli duration was considered in the GLM. Further, we incorporated an autoregressive model. The order of the model was four times the dataset-specific sampling frequency.
9. To calculate response estimates per ROI, the precomputed channel specificity was used to weight the contribution of each relevant channel (see 1) to the ROI. Specifically, the response estimates per channel of the GLM were weighted, and p-values were calculated based on the cumulative distribution function.
10. This procedure was performed for Hbo and Hbr separately.
11. For each subject, session, condition, channel, and ROI the response estimates and statistical test results against zero (including p-values, test-statistics, standard errors, and degrees of freedom) were provided.
 
Second-level analysis: Second-level analysis was performed in R. To evaluate hypothesis 4, 5, 6 and 7, one linear mixed model was formulated with the fixed effects of ROI (L IFG, Occipital Cortex), condition (control, noise, speech), and chromophore (Hbo, Hbr) as well as a random effect of subject. The model was formulated in the R package “lme4” with the code “lmm_result <- lmer (theta ~ -1 + Condition:Chroma:ROI + (1|ID), REML = T, data = lifg_s_n)”. Significance was assessed using the “summary” function of “lmerTest”. To evaluate hypothesis 5, we used the R package “emmeans” examining the contrast speech vs. noise, using the code “emmeans (lmm_result, pairwise ~ Condition | Chroma & ROI, adjust = ""none"")”. No p-value corrections were applied since specific hypothesis were tested with no more than one test per hypothesis. Prior to the analyses, the response estimates, theta values, were z standardized and outliers ( z > 3 & z < -3) removed. Results were consistent across chromophores. ";"First-level analysis was performed as described for study 1 (steps 1 – 10). In addition to separate estimates for Hbo and Hbr, we derived a combined estimate to test across chromophores. To this end, Hbr response estimates were inverted by -1 and combined with hbo response estimates to perform a combined significance test against zero. Specifically, a weighted average of response estimates from each channel and their standard deviation is used to calculate the p-value and t-value for each ROI. The t-value is calculated by dividing the weighted average of response estimates by the weighted average of the standard deviation. The degrees of freedom are then used to calculate the p-value using the cumulative distribution function of the t-distribution.
To test hypothesis 2, first-level analysis was performed for 2s left hand finger tapping on the right motor ROI and for 2s right hand finger tapping on the left motor ROI. Afterwards, the individual response estimates, channel specificity, and test statistics of GLMs of 2sleft and 2sright were used to calculate the combined response and to perform the hypothesis test against zero. Tests for Hypothesis 3 were performed analogously. To test hypothesis 4, we used the statistical results of the previous hypotheses to perform a t-test on the two t-statistics of combined 3s and 2s results to test the mean difference of 3s greater than 2s activity. 
";;;;;"No brain regions differed between left and right finger tapping.

Analysis: For the exploratory analysis, we performed the first-level analysis as described for study 1 (steps 1 - 10) using all regions of the Juelich atlas as ROIs. 

Second-level analysis: For each chromophore and brain region, we conducted a paired sample t-test comparing left and right hand finger tapping, combining the 2s and 3s conditions as described above. Prior to the analyses, theta values were z-standardized across chromophores and regions and outliers (z > 3, z < -3) removed. None of the t-tests were significant (in case of significant tests, we would have corrected the p-values using false discovery rate correction).

For each channel and subject, we computed a Cohen’s D value for each trial of silent, noise, and speech conditions independently, resulting in 16 subject x 25 channel x 3 conditions. Then, hypotheses 1-6 were tested via non-parametric bootstrap tests by generating pseudo-conditions via bootstrapping.
As an example, for the first hyopthesis, we obtained two 16x1 vectors consisting of Cohen’s D values for speech and silent conditions. Silent condition was used as a baseline for this hypothesis. Then, the observed difference between these two conditions were computed by first taking their average, followed by subtracting the average of silent from the average of the speech condition. Then, we pooled these two vectors, resampled 1000 times, resulting in different pseudo-silent and pseudo-speech conditions in each time. For each resampling, the difference between the mean value of two vectors were computed. As a result, we obtained 1000 average differences. Then, we calculated the significance of the observed difference via the following formula:

where CDbs  denotes Cohen’s D value difference between pseudocomnditions for each bootstrapping, CDobs denotes the observed difference between the means of two conditions , # (CDbs > CDobs) denotes the number of bootstrapped Cohen’s D difference values that are greater than the observed average difference between silent and speech trials, and nboot denotes the total number of bootstrapping (n=1000).

	Preprocessing of fNIRS data was performed with a combination of Homer3 functions and custom-made scripts written in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). 
	1) Raw light intensity data was first examined visually. 
	2) Then, channels with poor signal quality were determined with the coefficient of variation (CV) method (Piper et al., 2014; Pollonini et al., 2016; Hocke et al. 2018; Zimeo et al.2018). CV was computed as a percentage via CV (%) = 100 × standard deviation (data)/mean (data) where “data” refers to channel specific raw optical signals at 760 nm or 850 nm. Channels with raw light intensity signals above a CV  of 7.5%  were considered to be heavily contaminated with unphysiological noise and will be excluded from further processing (Hocke et al., 2018; Zimeo et al.,2018; Mutlu et al., 2020). Subjects whose fNIRS data contained more than 5 low-signal quality channels were excluded from further analysis. Only Subject 2 was excluded based on this criteria.
3) For the remaining subjects, channels with raw light intensity signals were removed from the analysis if SNR was less than 2 for any wavelength data by using the hmrR_PruneChannels function (SNRthresh = 2). 
4) Data segments with motion artifacts were detected per each channel with h hmrR_MotionArtifactByChannel function with the following parameters: tMotion = 0.5, tMask = 1, STDEVthresh = 5, and AMPthresh = 3 (Huppert, 2009). The raw intensity data were converted into optical density (OD) data with the hmrR_Intensity2OD function. Spikes and drifts in channel OD data were initially corrected with hmrR_MotionCorrectSplineSG function with the following parameters: p: 0.99 and FrameSize_sec: 10.
 
5) Motion corrected OD data were converted to HB data with the hmrR_OD2Conc function with DPF set to 1 for each wavelength. 
6) HBO and HBR data were bandpassfiltered with cut-off frequencies 0.01-0.5 Hz using a Butterworth filter embedded in hmrR_BandpassFilt function. 
 
7) Further traces of motion artifacts were corrected with the Correlation based signal improvement method (CBSI) by use of the hmrR_MotionCorrectCbsi function. 
 
8) From each long separation HB and HBO channel time series, data of the short channel with highest correlation was linearly regressed out utilizing a GLM procedure.
 
9) Each block data was truncated with a prestimulus baseline of 3 seconds and poststimulus interval of 10 seconds. A linear trend was removed from each truncated block signal with the detrend function of MATLAB. 

10) Truncated block time series were averaged across all blocks for each channel, stimulus and subject.

Channel Coregistration
 
The sensitivity of the probe for detecting brain hemodynamics was calculated with the method explained in Aasted et al. (2015). The channel locations were coregistered onto a standard brain in MNI space using the NIRS_SPM toolbox (Singh et al., 2005; Jang et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2009).  As the last step, the percentage of Brodmann areas covered by each channel were computed with the spatial registration toolbox of NIRS_SPM according to the Rorden’s brain atlas (Rorden and Brett, 2001) and Talairach Atlases. Channel 8 corresponded to left Heschl’s gyrus and Channel 32 corresponded to right Heschl s Gyrus with highest percentage of overlap. Similarly Channels 1,3,4, 6 corresponded to LIFG and Channels 16,17,19,20,21,22,23,24 corresponded to Occipital Cortex.

Computation of the Neurovascular Coupling Parameter 
10) We took a grand average of all block time series across all subjects, channels and stimuli for each experimental task and determined a time window after the stimulus onset that involved the peak amplitude of the hemodynamic response. For auditory data, the hemodynamic signals had an average peak response around 5.7 seconds with a standard deviation of 0.6 seconds.  Hence, we took the mean signal between a time window of 5 and 8 seconds from stimulus onset for block averaged signals of each channel and stimulus type as the signal of interest. We computed a Cohen’s D parameter for signal amplitude at this time window with the following formula:
 CD=(mean(activation period)-mean (baseline period))/Standard Deviation(baseline period).
Where activation period refers to time interval from 5 to 8 seconds and baseline period refers to time interval for prestimulus baseline of 3 seconds. The difference in mean amplitude of activation and baseline was normalized by scaling with the standard deviation of baseline amplitude.
Hypothesis Testing
Each hypothesis was tested with a bootstrapping methodology that involved permutation testing procedures.
For each channel and subject, we computed a Cohen’s D value for each trial of silent, noise, and speech conditions independently, resulting in 16 subject x 25 channel x 3 conditions. Then, hypotheses 1-6 were tested via non-parametric bootstrap tests by generating pseudo-conditions via bootstrapping.
As an example, for the first hyopthesis, we obtained two 16x1 vectors consisting of Cohen’s D values for speech and silent conditions. Silent condition was used as a baseline for this hypothesis. Then, the observed difference between these two conditions were computed by first taking their average, followed by subtracting the average of silent from the average of the speech condition. Then, we pooled these two vectors, resampled 1000 times, resulting in different pseudo-silent and pseudo-speech conditions in each time. For each resampling, the difference between the mean value of two vectors were computed. As a result, we obtained 1000 average differences. Then, we calculated the significance of the observed difference via the following formula:

where CDbs  denotes Cohen’s D value difference between pseudocomnditions for each bootstrapping, CDobs denotes the observed difference between the means of two conditions , # (CDbs > CDobs) denotes the number of bootstrapped Cohen’s D difference values that are greater than the observed average difference between silent and speech trials, and nboot denotes the total number of bootstrapping (n=1000).
Hypotheses 2-6 had a very similar mathematical architecture and we will give a detailed explanation in our second report.
 
For hypthesis 7, we first computed the Cohen’s D parameter from the block averaged signals of each channel and subject that belonged to silent condition. (Please note that for each channel, the number of NVC parameter (i.e., Cohen’s D) in the silent data vector equals the number of included subjects for that channel. Subject 2 was completely excluded from the analysis.) 
We then resampled Cohen’s D parameter in each ROI channel 1000 times with replacement and calculated the average Cohen’s D parameter of each sampling, resulting in a distribution of average Cohen’s D values. 
Then, we computed the p-value of the bootstrap test by calculating the percentage of bootstrapped average Cohen’s D values greater than zero as in the following:
                                          (2)
where # (CDbs > 0) denotes the number of bootstrapped average Cohen’s D is greater than zero, and nboot denotes the total number of bootstrapping (n=1000).
 
To sum up, the analysis pipeline can be summarized as follows

1.     Exclusion of Subjects with more than 5 bad quality channels (based on CV method with CV threshold set to 7.5 )
2.     Channel exclusion at the subject level with poor SNR criteria (hmrR_PruneChannels function (SNRthresh = 2). 
3.     Detection of temporal windows with motion artifacts by using hmrR_MotionArtifactByChannel function.
4.     Conversion of raw wavelength data to optical density data.
5.     Motion artifact correction with hmrR_MotionCorrectSplineSG
6.     Conversion of OD to HBX data.
7.     Bandpass filtering with high and low cut-off frequencies set to 0.01 and 0.5Hz (hmrR_BandpassFilt)
8.     Motion correction with CBSI method (hmrR_MotionCorrectCbsi function)
9.     Linear regression of short channel HBO/HBR time series with highest correlation from each long channel HBO/HBR time series.
10.  Truncation of each block with a prestimulus baseline of 3 seconds and poststimulus interval of 10 seconds.
11.  Removal of linear trends from each truncated block signal.
12.  Averaging  of blocks belonging to each stimulus type per each channel.
13.  Computation of the neurovascular coupling parameter.
14.  Hypothesis testing with a non-parametric bootstrapping approach using permutation tests.

Analysis Description *
Provided a detailed description of your analysis procedure for the first dataset, including all individual and group level procedures. If different procedures were used for different hypothesis, then describe each procedure and note for which hypothesis it applies.

Subject and channel exclusion criteria, preprocessing steps, computation of the neurovascular coupling parameter for HBO and HBR data and the statistical methods utilized for testing the above-mentioned hypotheses can be summarized as follows:
	Preprocessing of fNIRS data was performed with a combination of Homer3 functions and custom-made scripts written in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). 
	1) Raw light intensity data was first examined visually. 2) Then, channels with poor signal quality were determined with the coefficient of variation (CV) method (Piper et al., 2014; Pollonini et al., 2016; Hocke et al. 2018; Zimeo et al.2018). CV was computed as a percentage via CV (%) = 100 × standard deviation (data)/mean (data) where “data” refers to channel specific raw optical signals at 760 nm or 850 nm.  Channels with raw light intensity signals above a CV  of 7.5%  were considered to be heavily contaminated with unphysiological noise and will be excluded from further processing (Hocke et al., 2018; Zimeo et al.,2018; Mutlu et al., 2020). 
	2) Subjects whose fNIRS data contained more than 5 low-signal quality channels were excluded from further analysis. All subjects surpassed this threshold and were included in the analysis
3) Channels with raw light intensity signals were removed from the analysis if SNR was less than 2 for any wavelength data by using the hmrR_PruneChannels function (SNRthresh = 2). 

4) Data segments with motion artifacts were detected per each channel with h hmrR_MotionArtifactByChannel function with the following parameters: tMotion = 0.5, tMask = 1, STDEVthresh = 5, and AMPthresh = 3 (Huppert, 2009). 

5) The raw intensity data were converted into optical density (OD) data with the hmrR_Intensity2OD function. Spikes and drifts in channel OD data were initially corrected with 
hmrR_MotionCorrectSplineSG function with the following parameters: p: 0.99 and FrameSize_sec: 10.
 
6) Motion corrected OD data were converted to HB data with the hmrR_OD2Conc function with DPF set to 1 for each wavelength. 
 
7) HBO and HBR data were bandpassfiltered with cut-off frequencies 0.01-0.5 Hz using a Butterworth filter embedded in hmrR_BandpassFilt function. Further traces of motion artifacts were corrected with the Correlation based signal improvement method (CBSI) by use of the hmrR_MotionCorrectCbsi function. 
 
8) From each long separation HB and HBO channel time series, data of the short channel with highest correlation was linearly regressed out utilizing a GLM procedure. Each block data was truncated with a prestimulus baseline of 3 seconds and poststimulus interval of 10 seconds. A linear trend was removed from each truncated block signal with the detrend function of MATLAB. Truncated block time series were averaged across all blocks for each channel, stimulus and subject.

Channel Coregistration with Conventional Atlases
 
The sensitivity of the probe for detecting brain hemodynamics was calculated with the method explained in Aasted et al. (2015). The channel locations were coregistered onto a standard brain in MNI space using the NIRS_SPM toolbox (Singh et al., 2005; Jang et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2009).  As the last step, the percentage of Brodmann areas covered by each channel were computed with the spatial registration toolbox of NIRS_SPM according to the Rorden’s brain atlas (Rorden and Brett, 2001) and Talairach Atlases. Channels 10,15,16,21 had the highest percentage of overlap with left Primary Motor cortex while channels 44, 49, 50 and 55 had the highest percentage of overlap with right Primary Motor cortex.
Computation of the Neurovascular Coupling Parameter 
9) We took a grand average of all block time series across all subjects, channels and stimuli for each experimental task and determined a time window after the stimulus onset that involved the peak amplitude of the hemodynamic response. For motor data, the hemodynamic signals had a peak response around 6 seconds with 3 second stimuli having a slightly longer temporal delay for reaching a HRF peak. We took the mean signal between 4 and 8 seconds after stimulus onset for block averaged signals of each channel and stimulus type as the signal of interest. We computed a Cohen’s D parameter for signal amplitude at this time window with the following formula:
 d=(mean(activation period)-mean (baseline period))/Standard Deviation(baseline period).
Where activation period refers to time interval from 4 to 8 seconds and baseline period refers to time interval for prestimulus baseline of 3 seconds. The difference in mean amplitude of activation and baseline was normalized by scaling with the standard deviation of baseline amplitude.
Hypothesis Testing
Each hypothesis was tested with a bootstrapping methodology that involved permutation testing procedures.
Hypothesis Testing
For each channel and subject, we computed a Cohen’s D value for each trial of left and righ hand finger tapping conditions independently, resulting in 10subject x64 channel x3conditions. Then, hypotheses were tested at the individual subject level via non-parametric tests by generating pseudo-conditions via bootstrapping. 
 
A channel-based contrast for hypothesis 1 was investigated with a non-parametric permutation test with the following steps. First, the NVC parameters for left hand finger tapping of 2 second session were computed for each channel at the individual subject level. Second, block signals with random event onsets were generated for 1000 times for each channel and stimulus type and the corresponding NVC parameters were computed from these sham block data. Our channels of interest included Channels 44,49,50 and 55.
We then resampled Cohen’s D parameter in each ROI channel 1000 times with replacement and calculated the average Cohen’s D parameter of each sampling, resulting in a distribution of average Cohen’s D values. 
Then, we calculated the significance of the observed difference via the following formula:

where CDbs  denotes Cohen’s D value difference between pseudocondition for each bootstrapping, CDobs denotes the observed  mean CD value across all trials for a single subject at each channel , # (CDbs > CDobs) denotes the number of bootstrapped Cohen’s D difference values that are greater than the observed average CD value for fingertapping trial, and nboot denotes the total number of bootstrapping (n=1000).
 
To sum up, the analysis pipeline can be summarized as follows

1.Exclusion of Subjects with more than 5 bad quality channels (based on CV method with CV threshold set to 7.5 )
2.Channel exclusion at the subject level with poor SNR criteria (hmrR_PruneChannels function (SNRthresh = 2). 
3.Detection of temporal windows with motion artifacts by using hmrR_MotionArtifactByChannel function.
4.Conversion of raw wavelength data to optical density data.
1.     Motion artifact correction with hmrR_MotionCorrectSplineSG
2.     Conversion of OD to HBX data.
3.     Bandpass filtering with high and low cut-off frequencies set to 0.01 and 0.5Hz (hmrR_BandpassFilt)
4.     Motion correction with CBSI method (hmrR_MotionCorrectCbsi function)
5.     Linear regression of short channel HBO/HBR time series with highest correlation from each long channel HBO/HBR time series.
6.     Truncation of each block with a prestimulus baseline of 3 seconds and poststimulus interval of 10 seconds.
7.     Removal of linear trends from each truncated block signal.
8.     Averaging  of blocks belonging to each stimulus type per each channel.
9.     Computation of the neurovascular coupling parameter.
10.  Hypothesis testing with a non-parametric bootstrapping approach using permutation tests.

2) Then, channels with poor signal quality were determined with the coefficient of variation (CV) method (Piper et al., 2014; Pollonini et al., 2016; Hocke et al. 2018; Zimeo et al.2018). CV was computed as a percentage via CV (%) = 100 × standard deviation (data)/mean (data) where “data” refers to channel specific raw optical signals at 760 nm or 850 nm.  Channels with raw light intensity signals above a CV  of 7.5%  were considered to be heavily contaminated with unphysiological noise and will be excluded from further processing (Hocke et al., 2018; Zimeo et al.,2018; Mutlu et al., 2020). Subjects whose fNIRS data contained more than 5 low-signal quality channels were excluded from further analysis. Only Subject 2 was excluded based on this criteria.
3) For the remaining subjects, channels with raw light intensity signals were removed from the analysis if SNR was less than 2 for any wavelength data by using the hmrR_PruneChannels function (SNRthresh = 2). 
4) Data segments with motion artifacts were detected per each channel with h hmrR_MotionArtifactByChannel function with the following parameters: tMotion = 0.5, tMask = 1, STDEVthresh = 5, and AMPthresh = 3 (Huppert, 2009). The raw intensity data were converted into optical density (OD) data with the hmrR_Intensity2OD function. Spikes and drifts in channel OD data were initially corrected with hmrR_MotionCorrectSplineSG function with the following parameters: p: 0.99 and FrameSize_sec: 10.

5) Motion corrected OD data were converted to HB data with the hmrR_OD2Conc function with DPF set to 1 for each wavelength. 
6) HBO and HBR data were bandpassfiltered with cut-off frequencies 0.01-0.5 Hz using a Butterworth filter embedded in hmrR_BandpassFilt function. 

7) Further traces of motion artifacts were corrected with the Correlation based signal improvement method (CBSI) by use of the hmrR_MotionCorrectCbsi function. 

8) From each long separation HB and HBO channel time series, data of the short channel with highest correlation was linearly regressed out utilizing a GLM procedure.

9) Each block data was truncated with a prestimulus baseline of 3 seconds and poststimulus interval of 10 seconds. A linear trend was removed from each truncated block signal with the detrend function of MATLAB. 

10) Truncated block time series were averaged across all blocks for each channel, stimulus and subject.

Channel Coregistration

The sensitivity of the probe for detecting brain hemodynamics was calculated with the method explained in Aasted et al. (2015). The channel locations were coregistered onto a standard brain in MNI space using the NIRS_SPM toolbox (Singh et al., 2005; Jang et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2009).  As the last step, the percentage of Brodmann areas covered by each channel were computed with the spatial registration toolbox of NIRS_SPM according to the Rorden’s brain atlas (Rorden and Brett, 2001) and Talairach Atlases. Channel 8 corresponded to left Heschl’s gyrus and Channel 32 corresponded to right Heschl s Gyrus with highest percentage of overlap. Similarly Channels 1,3,4, 6 corresponded to LIFG and Channels 16,17,19,20,21,22,23,24 corresponded to Occipital Cortex.

Computation of the Neurovascular Coupling Parameter 
10) We took a grand average of all block time series across all subjects, channels and stimuli for each experimental task and determined a time window after the stimulus onset that involved the peak amplitude of the hemodynamic response. For auditory data, the hemodynamic signals had an average peak response around 5.7 seconds with a standard deviation of 0.6 seconds.  Hence, we took the mean signal between a time window of 5 and 8 seconds from stimulus onset for block averaged signals of each channel and stimulus type as the signal of interest. We computed a Cohen’s D parameter for signal amplitude at this time window with the following formula:
 CD=(mean(activation period)-mean (baseline period))/Standard Deviation(baseline period).
Where activation period refers to time interval from 5 to 8 seconds and baseline period refers to time interval for prestimulus baseline of 3 seconds. The difference in mean amplitude of activation and baseline was normalized by scaling with the standard deviation of baseline amplitude.
Hypothesis Testing
Each hypothesis was tested with a bootstrapping methodology that involved permutation testing procedures.
For each channel and subject, we computed a Cohen’s D value for each trial of silent, noise, and speech conditions independently, resulting in 16 subject x 25 channel x 3 conditions. Then, hypotheses 1-6 were tested via non-parametric bootstrap tests by generating pseudo-conditions via bootstrapping.
As an example, for the first hyopthesis, we obtained two 16x1 vectors consisting of Cohen’s D values for speech and silent conditions. Silent condition was used as a baseline for this hypothesis. Then, the observed difference between these two conditions were computed by first taking their average, followed by subtracting the average of silent from the average of the speech condition. Then, we pooled these two vectors, resampled 1000 times, resulting in different pseudo-silent and pseudo-speech conditions in each time. For each resampling, the difference between the mean value of two vectors were computed. As a result, we obtained 1000 average differences. Then, we calculated the significance of the observed difference via the following formula:
p=(? # (CD?_bs>? CD?_obs))/nboot
where CDbs  denotes Cohen’s D value difference between pseudocomnditions for each bootstrapping, CDobs denotes the observed difference between the means of two conditions , # (CDbs > CDobs) denotes the number of bootstrapped Cohen’s D difference values that are greater than the observed average difference between silent and speech trials, and nboot denotes the total number of bootstrapping (n=1000).
Hypotheses 2-6 had a very similar mathematical architecture and we will give a detailed explanation in our second report.

For hypthesis 7, we first computed the Cohen’s D parameter from the block averaged signals of each channel and subject that belonged to silent condition. (Please note that for each channel, the number of NVC parameter (i.e., Cohen’s D) in the silent data vector equals the number of included subjects for that channel. Subject 2 was completely excluded from the analysis.) 
We then resampled Cohen’s D parameter in each ROI channel 1000 times with replacement and calculated the average Cohen’s D parameter of each sampling, resulting in a distribution of average Cohen’s D values. 
Then, we computed the p-value of the bootstrap test by calculating the percentage of bootstrapped average Cohen’s D values greater than zero as in the following:
p=1-(? # (CD?_bs>0))/nboot	 			(2)
where # (CDbs > 0) denotes the number of bootstrapped average Cohen’s D is greater than zero, and nboot denotes the total number of bootstrapping (n=1000).

To sum up, the analysis pipeline can be summarized as follows

	Exclusion of Subjects with more than 5 bad quality channels (based on CV method with CV threshold set to 7.5 )

Analysis Description *
Provided a detailed description of your analysis procedure for the first dataset, including all individual and group level procedures. If different procedures were used for different hypothesis, then describe each procedure and note for which hypothesis it applies.

Subject and channel exclusion criteria, preprocessing steps, computation of the neurovascular coupling parameter for HBO and HBR data and the statistical methods utilized for testing the above-mentioned hypotheses can be summarized as follows:
	Preprocessing of fNIRS data was performed with a combination of Homer3 functions and custom-made scripts written in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). 
	1) Raw light intensity data was first examined visually. 2) Then, channels with poor signal quality were determined with the coefficient of variation (CV) method (Piper et al., 2014; Pollonini et al., 2016; Hocke et al. 2018; Zimeo et al.2018). CV was computed as a percentage via CV (%) = 100 × standard deviation (data)/mean (data) where “data” refers to channel specific raw optical signals at 760 nm or 850 nm.  Channels with raw light intensity signals above a CV  of 7.5%  were considered to be heavily contaminated with unphysiological noise and will be excluded from further processing (Hocke et al., 2018; Zimeo et al.,2018; Mutlu et al., 2020). 
	2) Subjects whose fNIRS data contained more than 5 low-signal quality channels were excluded from further analysis. All subjects surpassed this threshold and were included in the analysis
3) Channels with raw light intensity signals were removed from the analysis if SNR was less than 2 for any wavelength data by using the hmrR_PruneChannels function (SNRthresh = 2). 

4) Data segments with motion artifacts were detected per each channel with h hmrR_MotionArtifactByChannel function with the following parameters: tMotion = 0.5, tMask = 1, STDEVthresh = 5, and AMPthresh = 3 (Huppert, 2009). 

5) The raw intensity data were converted into optical density (OD) data with the hmrR_Intensity2OD function. Spikes and drifts in channel OD data were initially corrected with 
hmrR_MotionCorrectSplineSG function with the following parameters: p: 0.99 and FrameSize_sec: 10.
 
6) Motion corrected OD data were converted to HB data with the hmrR_OD2Conc function with DPF set to 1 for each wavelength. 
 
7) HBO and HBR data were bandpassfiltered with cut-off frequencies 0.01-0.5 Hz using a Butterworth filter embedded in hmrR_BandpassFilt function. Further traces of motion artifacts were corrected with the Correlation based signal improvement method (CBSI) by use of the hmrR_MotionCorrectCbsi function. 
 
8) From each long separation HB and HBO channel time series, data of the short channel with highest correlation was linearly regressed out utilizing a GLM procedure. Each block data was truncated with a prestimulus baseline of 3 seconds and poststimulus interval of 10 seconds. A linear trend was removed from each truncated block signal with the detrend function of MATLAB. Truncated block time series were averaged across all blocks for each channel, stimulus and subject.

Channel Coregistration with Conventional Atlases
 
The sensitivity of the probe for detecting brain hemodynamics was calculated with the method explained in Aasted et al. (2015). The channel locations were coregistered onto a standard brain in MNI space using the NIRS_SPM toolbox (Singh et al., 2005; Jang et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2009).  As the last step, the percentage of Brodmann areas covered by each channel were computed with the spatial registration toolbox of NIRS_SPM according to the Rorden’s brain atlas (Rorden and Brett, 2001) and Talairach Atlases. Channels 10,15,16,21 had the highest percentage of overlap with left Primary Motor cortex while channels 44, 49, 50 and 55 had the highest percentage of overlap with right Primary Motor cortex.
Computation of the Neurovascular Coupling Parameter 
9) We took a grand average of all block time series across all subjects, channels and stimuli for each experimental task and determined a time window after the stimulus onset that involved the peak amplitude of the hemodynamic response. For motor data, the hemodynamic signals had a peak response around 6 seconds with 3 second stimuli having a slightly longer temporal delay for reaching a HRF peak. We took the mean signal between 4 and 8 seconds after stimulus onset for block averaged signals of each channel and stimulus type as the signal of interest. We computed a Cohen’s D parameter for signal amplitude at this time window with the following formula:
 d=(mean(activation period)-mean (baseline period))/Standard Deviation(baseline period).
Where activation period refers to time interval from 4 to 8 seconds and baseline period refers to time interval for prestimulus baseline of 3 seconds. The difference in mean amplitude of activation and baseline was normalized by scaling with the standard deviation of baseline amplitude.
Hypothesis Testing
Each hypothesis was tested with a bootstrapping methodology that involved permutation testing procedures.
Hypothesis Testing
For each channel and subject, we computed a Cohen’s D value for each trial of left and righ hand finger tapping conditions independently, resulting in 10subject x64 channel x3conditions. Then, hypotheses were tested at the individual subject level via non-parametric tests by generating pseudo-conditions via bootstrapping. 
 
A channel-based contrast for hypothesis 1 was investigated with a non-parametric permutation test with the following steps. First, the NVC parameters for left hand finger tapping of 2 second session were computed for each channel at the individual subject level. Second, block signals with random event onsets were generated for 1000 times for each channel and stimulus type and the corresponding NVC parameters were computed from these sham block data. Our channels of interest included Channels 44,49,50 and 55.
We then resampled Cohen’s D parameter in each ROI channel 1000 times with replacement and calculated the average Cohen’s D parameter of each sampling, resulting in a distribution of average Cohen’s D values. 
Then, we calculated the significance of the observed difference via the following formula:

where CDbs  denotes Cohen’s D value difference between pseudocondition for each bootstrapping, CDobs denotes the observed  mean CD value across all trials for a single subject at each channel , # (CDbs > CDobs) denotes the number of bootstrapped Cohen’s D difference values that are greater than the observed average CD value for fingertapping trial, and nboot denotes the total number of bootstrapping (n=1000).
 
To sum up, the analysis pipeline can be summarized as follows

1.Exclusion of Subjects with more than 5 bad quality channels (based on CV method with CV threshold set to 7.5 )
2.Channel exclusion at the subject level with poor SNR criteria (hmrR_PruneChannels function (SNRthresh = 2). 
3.Detection of temporal windows with motion artifacts by using hmrR_MotionArtifactByChannel function.
4.Conversion of raw wavelength data to optical density data.
1.     Motion artifact correction with hmrR_MotionCorrectSplineSG
2.     Conversion of OD to HBX data.
3.     Bandpass filtering with high and low cut-off frequencies set to 0.01 and 0.5Hz (hmrR_BandpassFilt)
4.     Motion correction with CBSI method (hmrR_MotionCorrectCbsi function)

2) Then, channels with poor signal quality were determined with the coefficient of variation (CV) method (Piper et al., 2014; Pollonini et al., 2016; Hocke et al. 2018; Zimeo et al.2018). CV was computed as a percentage via CV (%) = 100 × standard deviation (data)/mean (data) where “data” refers to channel specific raw optical signals at 760 nm or 850 nm.  Channels with raw light intensity signals above a CV  of 7.5%  were considered to be heavily contaminated with unphysiological noise and will be excluded from further processing (Hocke et al., 2018; Zimeo et al.,2018; Mutlu et al., 2020). Subjects whose fNIRS data contained more than 5 low-signal quality channels were excluded from further analysis. Only Subject 2 was excluded based on this criteria.
3) For the remaining subjects, channels with raw light intensity signals were removed from the analysis if SNR was less than 2 for any wavelength data by using the hmrR_PruneChannels function (SNRthresh = 2). 
4) Data segments with motion artifacts were detected per each channel with h hmrR_MotionArtifactByChannel function with the following parameters: tMotion = 0.5, tMask = 1, STDEVthresh = 5, and AMPthresh = 3 (Huppert, 2009). The raw intensity data were converted into optical density (OD) data with the hmrR_Intensity2OD function. Spikes and drifts in channel OD data were initially corrected with hmrR_MotionCorrectSplineSG function with the following parameters: p: 0.99 and FrameSize_sec: 10.

5) Motion corrected OD data were converted to HB data with the hmrR_OD2Conc function with DPF set to 1 for each wavelength. 
6) HBO and HBR data were bandpassfiltered with cut-off frequencies 0.01-0.5 Hz using a Butterworth filter embedded in hmrR_BandpassFilt function. 

7) Further traces of motion artifacts were corrected with the Correlation based signal improvement method (CBSI) by use of the hmrR_MotionCorrectCbsi function. 

8) From each long separation HB and HBO channel time series, data of the short channel with highest correlation was linearly regressed out utilizing a GLM procedure.

9) Each block data was truncated with a prestimulus baseline of 3 seconds and poststimulus interval of 10 seconds. A linear trend was removed from each truncated block signal with the detrend function of MATLAB. 

10) Truncated block time series were averaged across all blocks for each channel, stimulus and subject.

Channel Coregistration

The sensitivity of the probe for detecting brain hemodynamics was calculated with the method explained in Aasted et al. (2015). The channel locations were coregistered onto a standard brain in MNI space using the NIRS_SPM toolbox (Singh et al., 2005; Jang et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2009).  As the last step, the percentage of Brodmann areas covered by each channel were computed with the spatial registration toolbox of NIRS_SPM according to the Rorden’s brain atlas (Rorden and Brett, 2001) and Talairach Atlases. Channel 8 corresponded to left Heschl’s gyrus and Channel 32 corresponded to right Heschl s Gyrus with highest percentage of overlap. Similarly Channels 1,3,4, 6 corresponded to LIFG and Channels 16,17,19,20,21,22,23,24 corresponded to Occipital Cortex.

Computation of the Neurovascular Coupling Parameter 
10) We took a grand average of all block time series across all subjects, channels and stimuli for each experimental task and determined a time window after the stimulus onset that involved the peak amplitude of the hemodynamic response. For auditory data, the hemodynamic signals had an average peak response around 5.7 seconds with a standard deviation of 0.6 seconds.  Hence, we took the mean signal between a time window of 5 and 8 seconds from stimulus onset for block averaged signals of each channel and stimulus type as the signal of interest. We computed a Cohen’s D parameter for signal amplitude at this time window with the following formula:
 CD=(mean(activation period)-mean (baseline period))/Standard Deviation(baseline period).
Where activation period refers to time interval from 5 to 8 seconds and baseline period refers to time interval for prestimulus baseline of 3 seconds. The difference in mean amplitude of activation and baseline was normalized by scaling with the standard deviation of baseline amplitude.
Hypothesis Testing
Each hypothesis was tested with a bootstrapping methodology that involved permutation testing procedures.
For each channel and subject, we computed a Cohen’s D value for each trial of silent, noise, and speech conditions independently, resulting in 16 subject x 25 channel x 3 conditions. Then, hypotheses 1-6 were tested via non-parametric bootstrap tests by generating pseudo-conditions via bootstrapping.
As an example, for the first hyopthesis, we obtained two 16x1 vectors consisting of Cohen’s D values for speech and silent conditions. Silent condition was used as a baseline for this hypothesis. Then, the observed difference between these two conditions were computed by first taking their average, followed by subtracting the average of silent from the average of the speech condition. Then, we pooled these two vectors, resampled 1000 times, resulting in different pseudo-silent and pseudo-speech conditions in each time. For each resampling, the difference between the mean value of two vectors were computed. As a result, we obtained 1000 average differences. Then, we calculated the significance of the observed difference via the following formula:
p=(? # (CD?_bs>? CD?_obs))/nboot
where CDbs  denotes Cohen’s D value difference between pseudocomnditions for each bootstrapping, CDobs denotes the observed difference between the means of two conditions , # (CDbs > CDobs) denotes the number of bootstrapped Cohen’s D difference values that are greater than the observed average difference between silent and speech trials, and nboot denotes the total number of bootstrapping (n=1000).
Hypotheses 2-6 had a very similar mathematical architecture and we will give a detailed explanation in our second report.

For hypthesis 7, we first computed the Cohen’s D parameter from the block averaged signals of each channel and subject that belonged to silent condition. (Please note that for each channel, the number of NVC parameter (i.e., Cohen’s D) in the silent data vector equals the number of included subjects for that channel. Subject 2 was completely excluded from the analysis.) 
We then resampled Cohen’s D parameter in each ROI channel 1000 times with replacement and calculated the average Cohen’s D parameter of each sampling, resulting in a distribution of average Cohen’s D values. 
Then, we computed the p-value of the bootstrap test by calculating the percentage of bootstrapped average Cohen’s D values greater than zero as in the following:
p=1-(? # (CD?_bs>0))/nboot	 			(2)
where # (CDbs > 0) denotes the number of bootstrapped average Cohen’s D is greater than zero, and nboot denotes the total number of bootstrapping (n=1000).

To sum up, the analysis pipeline can be summarized as follows

	Exclusion of Subjects with more than 5 bad quality channels (based on CV method with CV threshold set to 7.5 )
	Channel exclusion at the subject level with poor SNR criteria (hmrR_PruneChannels function (SNRthresh = 2).

In summary, we analyzed the data by the following two approaches.

Block averaging:
1. Select measurements corresponding to the channels in the ROIs
2. Carry out tomographic reconstruction of data for a fixed duration after stimulus onset
3. Conduct a t-test on the average peak activation values in the window
4. Visualize HbO and HbR time traces for ROIs and tomographic maps
5. Repeat for all events
6. Address Hypotheses

GLM:
1. Model responses to each event as a column in the design matrix by convolving with an HRF
2. The design matrix consisted of a constant term (column 1), and 20 control, 20 noise, and 20 speech events (total 61 columns).: 
3. Averaged over the 20 corresponding beta maps for each condition (control, noise, and speech) to create one map per subject.
4. Calculated the mean beta maps for all 3 conditions and the speech minus noise map.
5. Calculated a random effect t-statistics map across these 17 beta maps (next slide row 2).
6. Visualized the thresholded t-maps 
7. Address Hypotheses

";"To validate the brain activation for each tasks, we have conducted following steps:
1.   Assign the pulse and synchpts for the rest and task period (pre-steps for the GLM)
2.   Block average to get the mean HbO maps. 
·      Unify the block length. In this step, we unify the block length with the fixed resting duration (i.e., 10 s), since the resting period is not consistent from 10s to 20s in the original dataset case. So the block length will be 13s for the 3s left & right finger tapping task, and 12 s for the 2s task case. 
·      Calculate the mean HbO maps. We utilize the snchpts of each pulse as the onset reference to average the HbO for all of the blocks. To quantify the mean activation level, we further selected the activation period (5~10 s) to calculate the mean values for each voxel (124453 voxels). Moreover, we project the voxels in the 3D domain to get mean maps. The higher activation (red color) indicated the location which are more HbO involved due to the task. The blue color in the mean map demonstrated the de-active brain region. 
3.   Calculate the beta values/maps using GLM. In order to generate the statistical significance, we build the design matrix with columns of twice of block numbers (BN) and pulse the constant columns (?0). Therefore, we can get the 2BL+1 beta values for each task, in the other words, each of the block’s measurements can be fitting their own HRF and obtain the beta value. We further used the mean task beta values subtract the mean rest beta values (baseline or control condition) for each voxels. Then, the beta maps can be generated by projecting the beta value in the 3D domain. 
4.   Statistical significance (t-maps and significant maps/p-maps) for the activation location (Welch’s t test). We have calculate the t-values, p-values, degree of freedom, and Cohen’s d effect size to quantify the significance of activation locations/voxels between the task and resting periods among the blocks. The voxel-based t-values are used to generate the t-map. We used the cumulative t-distribution function to define the t-threshold with the p-value < 0.001. Furthermore, the t-values are higher than the threshold used to create the significant maps (or p-maps). The brain regions highlighted in the p-map illustrated that this location have a higher response than other regions and with a significant different with the rest period with p-value < 0.001.
5.   ROIs selections and ROIs seeds generation. To compare the activation level between the 2s and 3s task, we select the ROIs for each source-detector pairs within the motor cortex (i.e., precentral and postcentral motor gyrus) using the reference MNI coordinator presented in the Novi et al., 2020. Herein, we selected 20 ROIs (10 ROIs for each hemisphere). Additionally, we extended the ROI regions based on the central of each ROIs 3D coordinator using the kernel function with 2.5mm radius. Therefore, the size of the each seeds are 5 mm (i.e., around 165 voxels).
6.   Comparison of the hemodynamic response between 2s and 3s finger tapping task. In this step, we averaged the t-values and beta-values within the ROI seeds to quantify the activation levels for each task (i.e., shown in the bar chart). In order to validate the significant difference, we calculated the p-values using the beta values of the 2s and 3s finger tapping task within the ROIs. Herein, the higher t-value and beta values indicated the higher brain activation evoked by finger tapping task.

In one subject, task-irrelevant artifacts occurred after the experiment and thus the fNIRS signal was cut at the end. For data preprocessing of all subjects, the temporal derivative distribution repair (TDDR) algorithm was used to correct for high-amplitude motion artifacts. Next, correlation-based signal improvement (CBSI) was used, which is a method for artifact correction based on the negative correlation between O2Hb and HHb. A bandpass filter of 0.02–0.3 Hz was applied based on a fourier transformation. (Note that the high-pass filter was changed from originally 0.01 Hz to 0.02 Hz to filter out a low frequency in the signal occurring in several subjects.) As short-channels were not used for signal correction, a global component of the signal was detected by a principal component analysis (PCA) with ? = 20 and eliminated by a kernel filter. Remaining noisy channels were interpolated by surrounding channels. The data was standardized by using a z-transformation within each subject across all channels (excluding short-distance channels). 
The fNIRS data of each subject and channel was further analyzed within a model-based approach: a general linear model (GLM) was computed for each subject, channel, and condition according to the standard hemodynamic response function (assuming a peak at 6 s). For each region of interest (ROIs: left and right Heschl gyri, left inferior frontal gyrus, occipital cortex), the beta values of all channels within the respective ROI were averaged for statistical analysis. The resulting beta values were compared in one-sided t-tests against 0 or paired t-tests depending on the hypothesis (? = .05). 
For testing lateralization in the Heschl gyri (H3), a laterality index of functional brain activation (LI) was calculated for each participant according to the formula (R ? L) ÷ (abs(R) + abs(L)) × 100, whereby L and R depict the beta value of this ROI in the left and right hemisphere, respectively. Negative values for LI indicate a lateralization towards the left hemisphere, while positive values indicate a lateralization towards the right hemisphere.

Signal quality: an SCI value is calculated for each channel, over the entire length of the signal, for each SNIRF file. Channels with SCI < 0.7 are marked as bad channels.

Preprocessing: SNIRF files are loaded and channels marked bad are pruned by replacing their data with NaN. Stimuli are manually fixed (renaming stimuli and fixing their durations). Short-separation channels are marked as those with 8.5 mm separation or less. Data is cut to 1 second before first stimulus, and 1 second after last stimulus. Optical density is then calculated, and hemoglobin changes obtained by MBLL. Partial path-length factor PPF was set to 0.1 (toolbox default).

First-level analysis: Hemoglobin changes (HbO, HHb) were used in an AR-IRLS GLM model (toolbox implementation), with short-separation channels included as regressors.

Second-level analysis: a mixed-effects was used for group analysis. In Wilkinson-Rogers notation it was set as beta ~ -1 + cond + (1|SubjectID). The model is solved with the covariance from first-level models using weighted least-squares (toolbox implementation).

Using the Juelich atlas, left and right Heschl's gyri were selected, as well as left inferior frontal gyrus and occipital cortex. Channels in fOLD corresponding to the channels in the dataset were selected for each ROI. Channels in each ROI was weighted by the specificity of each source-detector pair in fOLD for the region, normalized by MATLAB’s normalize function as normalize(weights, 'norm', 1).

";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Not investigated.;"First Level Analysis and Preprocessing:
The fNIRS data were preprocessed in the following way. First, channels with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were discarded. SNR was defined as the mean intensity divided by the standard deviation, and we used a threshold of 8. For the short channels, we additionally inspected their power spectrum. Short channels without a 1/f decay and clear peak around 1Hz were removed from further analysis. Next, light intensity of each remaining channel was converted  to optical density then corrected for motion artifacts with spline interpolation followed by wavelet decomposition. Hemoglobin (HB) concentration changes were estimated with the Modified Beer-Lambert law with differential pathlength equals to 6. Finally, HB time-series were low-pass filtered at 0.5 Hz.
        	For investigating the evoked hemodynamic response due to the task, each channel was classified as activated or not activated. A channel was classified as activated if it presented a significant and characteristic hemodynamic response for both oxy-(HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR), positive/negative response for HbO/HbR (T-test, p ? 0.05). The dynamics of the hemodynamic response was inferred by a general linear model (GLM) with a gamma function in which each HbO and HbR signals from each good short channel was added as a regressor of noninterest. The GLM was solved with robust fit and with an iterative approach with pre-whitening for removing serially correlated errors after performing PCA over the short channels columns (all principal components were included). 
Region of interest: We selected the channels in the primary motor cortex (PMC), anatomically located at the precentral gyrus, using AtlasViewer to project the channels on the cortex. We found a total of 7 channels in the PMC of each hemisphere.
Left PMC: [9 10 14 15 16 21 25].
Right PMC: [43 44 48 49 50 55 59].

Hypothesis 1: Any participant with at least one channel in the contralateral PMC was considered as a “yes”.
 
General approach for Hypothesis 2, 3 and 4: For addressing these hypotheses,  we performed T-tests for HbO and HbR by combining the first-level statistics (the betas and covariance matrices) of each task. Importantly, we corrected for the fact that the channels in the contralateral PMC of the right hand were different from the left hand. In other words, we combined each channel in the PMC from the right hemisphere with its equivalent in the left hemisphere.

Hypothesis 2:  The T-test for each hemoglobin and each channel in the PMC was performed in the following way:

Beta_Hb = Beta_Hb_right_3s  + Beta_Hb_left_3s.
Cov_Hb = Cov_Hb_right_3s  + Cov_Hb_right_3s.
T_Hb = Beta_Hb/(sqrt(Cov_Hb)).

For each participant, the hypothesis was considered as proved (“yes”) if there was at least one channel with significant and positive T_HbO and significant and negative T_HbR computed as above.

Hypothesis 3:  The T-test for each hemoglobin and each channel in the PMC was performed in the following way:

Beta_Hb = Beta_Hb_right_3s  + Beta_Hb_left_3s + Beta_Hb_right_2s  + Beta_Hb_left_2s.
Cov_Hb = Cov_Hb_right_3s  + Cov_Hb_right_3s + Cov_Hb_right_2s  + Cov_Hb_right_2s.
T_Hb = Beta_Hb/(sqrt(Cov_Hb)).

For each participant, the hypothesis was considered as proved (“yes”) following the same criteria described in Hypothesis 2.

Hypothesis 4:  The T-test for each hemoglobin and each channel in the PMC was performed in the following way:

Beta_Hb = (Beta_Hb_right_3s  + Beta_Hb_left_3s) – ( Beta_Hb_right_2s  + Beta_Hb_left_2s).
Cov_Hb = Cov_Hb_right_3s  + Cov_Hb_right_3s + Cov_Hb_right_2s  + Cov_Hb_right_2s.
T_Hb = Beta_Hb/(sqrt(Cov_Hb)).

For each participant, the hypothesis was considered as proved (“yes”) if there were more channels with significant and positive T_HbO and significant and negative T_HbR for this combination than for the opposite one:  T_Hb_inverse = -Beta_Hb_inverse/(sqrt(Cov_Hb)).";;;;;"Since there is a high variability in the results of each participant, we addressed this last question with group analysis. We performed group analysis separately for each task and condition with a weighted-linear regression that takes into account the different errors in the beta-values of each channel from the first-level analysis (i.e. the covariance of each beta). As in the first-level analysis, a channel was considered as activated if it presented significant positive/negative group beta for HbO/HbR. 

In the group analysis (Figure 1 in the attached file), we observed that although there are different activated regions across left and right hands, the right-hand-2s task looked much more like the left-hand-2s than to the right-hand-3-s. In order to quantify similarity across conditions, we calculated the overlap reproducibility across conditions (equation below). We found that the highest agreements between tasks occurred for the pairs: (1) right-hand-2-s and left-hand-2s (R = 0.73); and (2) right-hand-3-s and left-hand-3s (R = 0.73). The similarity within right-tasks and within left-tasks were R = 0.50 and R = 0.47, respectively. Moreover, although all conditions presented a bilateral hemodynamic response, the right-hand-2s and left-hand-2s presented a broader response in the left PMC, while right-hand-3s and left-hand-3s majorly evoked responses in the right PMC.  

The reproducibility between a pair of tasks i and j was computed as:

First, channels with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were discarded. SNR was defined as the mean intensity divided by the standard deviation, and we used a threshold of 8. For the short channels, we additionally inspected their power spectrum. Short channels without a 1/f decay and clear peak around 1Hz were removed from further analysis. Participants that did not have at least one good short channel were discarded from further analysis. This criterion led to the exclusion of participant 2. Next, light intensity of each remaining channel was converted  to optical density then corrected for motion artifacts with spline interpolation followed by wavelet decomposition. Hemoglobin (HB) concentration changes were estimated with the Modified Beer-Lambert law with differential pathlength equals to 6. Finally, HB time-series were low-pass filtered at 0.5 Hz.
        	The dynamics of the hemodynamic response was inferred by a general linear model (GLM) with a gamma function in which each HbO and HbR signals from each good short channel was added as a regressor of noninterest. The GLM was solved with robust fit and with an iterative approach with pre-whitening for removing serially correlated errors after performing PCA over the short channels columns (all principal components were included). Group analysis was performed with a weighted-linear regression that takes into account the different errors in the beta-values of each channel of the first-level analysis (i.e. the covariance of each beta). For comparing different tasks, we used a contrast vector in the stats from the first level that combines the betas and covariance terms for each comparison accordingly. 
	We projected each channel in the brain cortex with AtlasViewer. The channels inside of each region of interests are: 
Left HG: channel 8.
Right HG: channel 32.
LIFG: channels 3, 4, and 6. 
Occipital: channels 16, 17, 19, 23 and 24. 


Hypothesis 1: We verified if channel 8 presented statistically significant (p<0.05) positive group beta for HbO, and statistically significant (p<0.05) negative group beta for HbR for speech stimuli.

Hypothesis 2: We employed the contrast C = (Speech - Noise) for channel 8 at the first level then performed the group analysis. The hypothesis was verified if channel 8 presented statistically significant (p<0.05) positive group beta for HbO, and statistically significant (p<0.05) negative group beta for HbR (for the contrast). 

Hypothesis 3: We verified this hypothesis similarly to Hypothesis 2, but with the channel-wise contrast of C = Channel 8 - Channel 32 for speech stimuli. The hypothesis was verified if the contrast presented statistically significant (p<0.05) positive group beta for HbO, and statistically significant (p<0.05) negative group beta for HbR (for the contrast). 

Hypothesis 4: We verified if any of the channels in the LIFG presented statistically significant (p<0.05) positive group beta for HbO, and statistically significant (p<0.05) negative group beta for HbR for speech stimuli.

Hypothesis 5: We employed the contrast C1 = (Speech - Noise) and its inverse C2 = (Noise-Speech). The hypothesis was verified if C1 produced more activated channels in the LIFG than C2 (again, statistically significant (p<0.05) positive group beta for HbO, and statistically significant (p<0.05) negative group beta for HbR).

Hypothesis 6: We verified if channels 16, 19, 23 and 24 presented statistically significant (p<0.05) positive group beta for HbO, and statistically significant (p<0.05) negative group beta for HbR for speech stimuli.

Hypothesis 7: We verified if channels 16, 19, 23 and 24 presented statistically significant (p<0.05) positive group beta for HbO, and statistically significant (p<0.05) negative group beta for HbR for silence condition.

";"The fNIRS data were preprocessed in the following way. First, channels with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were discarded. SNR was defined as the mean intensity divided by the standard deviation, and we used a threshold of 8. For the short channels, we additionally inspected their power spectrum. Short channels without a 1/f decay and clear peak around 1Hz were removed from further analysis. Next, light intensity of each remaining channel was converted  to optical density then corrected for motion artifacts with spline interpolation followed by wavelet decomposition. Hemoglobin (HB) concentration changes were estimated with the Modified Beer-Lambert law with differential pathlength equals to 6. Finally, HB time-series were low-pass filtered at 0.5 Hz.
        	For investigating the evoked hemodynamic response due to the task, each channel was classified as activated or not activated. A channel was classified as activated if it presented a significant and characteristic hemodynamic response for both oxy-(HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR), positive/negative response for HbO/HbR (T-test, p ? 0.05). The dynamics of the hemodynamic response was inferred by a general linear model (GLM) with a gamma function in which each HbO and HbR signals from each good short channel was added as a regressor of noninterest. The GLM was solved with robust fit and with an iterative approach with pre-whitening for removing serially correlated errors after performing PCA over the short channels columns (all principal components were included). 
Region of interest: We selected the channels in the primary motor cortex (PMC), anatomically located at the precentral gyrus, using AtlasViewer to project the channels on the cortex. We found a total of 7 channels in the PMC of each hemisphere.
Left PMC: [9 10 14 15 16 21 25].
Right PMC: [43 44 48 49 50 55 59].
Hypothesis 1: Any participant with at least one channel in the contralateral PMC was considered as a “yes”.
 
 
General approach for Hypothesis 2, 3 and 4: For addressing these hypotheses,  we performed T-tests for HbO and HbR by combining the first-level statistics (the betas and covariance matrices) of each task. Importantly, we corrected for the fact that the channels in the contralateral PMC of the right hand were different from the left hand. In other words, we combined each channel in the PMC from the right hemisphere with its equivalent in the left hemisphere.

Hypothesis 2:  The T-test for each hemoglobin and each channel in the PMC was performed in the following way:
Beta_Hb = Beta_Hb_right_3s  + Beta_Hb_left_3s.
Cov_Hb = Cov_Hb_right_3s  + Cov_Hb_right_3s.
T_Hb = Beta_Hb/(sqrt(Cov_Hb)).
For each participant, the hypothesis was considered as proved (“yes”) if there was at least one channel with significant and positive T_HbO and significant and negative T_HbR computed as above.

Hypothesis 3:  The T-test for each hemoglobin and each channel in the PMC was performed in the following way:
Beta_Hb = Beta_Hb_right_3s  + Beta_Hb_left_3s + Beta_Hb_right_2s  + Beta_Hb_left_2s.
Cov_Hb = Cov_Hb_right_3s  + Cov_Hb_right_3s + Cov_Hb_right_2s  + Cov_Hb_right_2s.
T_Hb = Beta_Hb/(sqrt(Cov_Hb)).
For each participant, the hypothesis was considered as proved (“yes”) following the same criteria described in Hypothesis 2.

Hypothesis 4:  The T-test for each hemoglobin and each channel in the PMC was performed in the following way:
Beta_Hb = (Beta_Hb_right_3s  + Beta_Hb_left_3s) – ( Beta_Hb_right_2s  + Beta_Hb_left_2s).
Cov_Hb = Cov_Hb_right_3s  + Cov_Hb_right_3s + Cov_Hb_right_2s  + Cov_Hb_right_2s.
T_Hb = Beta_Hb/(sqrt(Cov_Hb)).
For each participant, the hypothesis was considered as proved (“yes”) if there were more channels with significant and positive T_HbO and significant and negative T_HbR for this combination than for the opposite one:  T_Hb_inverse = -Beta_Hb_inverse/(sqrt(Cov_Hb)).

";;;;;"Since there is a high variability in the results of each participant, we addressed this last question with group analysis. We performed group analysis separately for each task and condition with a weighted-linear regression that takes into account the different errors in the beta-values of each channel from the first-level analysis (i.e. the covariance of each beta). As in the first-level analysis, a channel was considered as activated if it presented significant positive/negative group beta for HbO/HbR. 

In the group analysis (Figure 1 in the attached file), we observed that although there are different activated regions across left and right hands, the right-hand-2s task looked much more like the left-hand-2s than to the right-hand-3-s. In order to quantify similarity across conditions, we calculated the overlap reproducibility across conditions (equation below). We found that the highest agreements between tasks occurred for the pairs: (1) right-hand-2-s and left-hand-2s (R = 0.73); and (2) right-hand-3-s and left-hand-3s (R = 0.73). The similarity within right-tasks and within left-tasks were R = 0.50 and R = 0.47, respectively. Moreover, although all conditions presented a bilateral hemodynamic response, the right-hand-2s and left-hand-2s presented a broader response in the left PMC, while right-hand-3s and left-hand-3s majorly evoked responses in the right PMC.  

The reproducibility between a pair of tasks i and j was computed as:
R = 2x(Ai,joverlap)/(Ai + Aj),
in which Ai,joverlap is the number of channels that are activated for both tasks i and j, and Ai is the number of channels activated for task i.

Data were processed and analyzed in MATLAB R2017b (The MathWorks, Natick, MA) using Homer3  (v1.54.0) 1 and custom-made scripts, as illustrated in Figure 2. First, the raw time-series went through a quality control process where readings with very high or very low optical density changes, insufficient signal to noise ratio (SNR were excluded from further analysis, using the hmrR_PruneChannels function (dRange 0  to 1e7, SNRthresh=5, SDrange=0.45). Then, the raw data were transformed to units of change in optical density (?OD). Motion artifacts were identified on a channel-by-channel basis using the hmrR_MotionArtifactByChannel function. Briefly, if the signal amplitude was larger than 5 (AMPthresh) or the standard deviation augmented by a factor of 50 (SDthresh) over a time window of 1 s (tMotion), then a segment of the time series of 1s length (tMask) was identified as motion artifact. The data in the motion contaminated segments was interpolated by a Savitzky-Golay spline using the hmrR_MotionCorrectSplineSG function with a frame size of 2.5 seconds, which is shorter than the stimulus to avoid smoothing out the hemodynamic response 2, then if a stimulus was identified to contain a motion artifact within a -2 to 10 seconds window it was rejected using the hmrR_StimRejection function. Finally the OD data was bandpass filtered between 0.01 and 0.7 Hz, as instructed by Luke et al.3. OD data was converted into Hb concentration values using the modified Beer-Lambert law without any assumption of partial pathlength factors, hence the resulting units are micromolar*mm. The individual HRF were estimated via a General Linear Model (hmrR_GLM). The analyzed range was from 2 seconds before stimulus onset to 13 seconds post-stimulation. The GLM was solved by ordinary least squares 4. A consecutive series of 1-second wide gaussian functions interspaced 1 second was used as basis function. Channels spaced by less than 15 mm were considered short-separation and the short channel with the greatest correlation was used to regress the superficial hemodynamics from the estimated HRF 5,6. A polynomial correction of order 3 was implemented. No contrast vector was provided at this stage of the analysis.
Group level procedure
Data from the GLM estimation of the HRF (variable output.dcAvg.timeSeries) were extracted for each participant. Then, the mean time courses of the estimated HRF were computed for each condition (silence, speech, and noise) and for each region of interest ROI (Left Inferior Frontal Gyrus, left and right superior temporal [Heschl's] gyrus, and occipital).  Channels corresponding to each ROI were chosen as described by Luke et al.3. From these averaged time courses baseline conditions were extracted from the average of two seconds before stimulus onset, and the corresponding response was computed as the maximum HbO signal between 5 and 7 seconds post-stimuli onset. 
Normality was not tested with Shapiro-Wilk or any other tests, due to the relatively small sample size (n=17) non-normality was assumed. A Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine if there was a significant difference between the median of any two groups involved in the hypotheses under test. This is a non-parametric test, appropriate for paired data. A level of alpha=0.05 was considered for statistical significance. Since a few ROI were chosen a priori, no corrections for false positives were carried out (false-discovery rate, Bonferroni, etc.) 7,8. A two-tailed test was used to assess activation with respect to baseline (hypotheses 1,  4,  6, and 7 ) while one-tailed test was used when a response was expected to be larger in a specific ROI (hypotheses 2, 3, and 5).";"Individual level procedure

Data from the GLM estimation of the HRF (variable output.dcAvg. dataTimeSeries and output.dcAvgStd.dataTimeSeries) were extracted for each participant. Then, the mean time courses of the estimated HRF were computed for each condition (2 sec. left finger-tapping, 3 sec. left finger-tapping, 2 sec. right finger-tapping & 3 sec. right finger-tapping). From these averaged time courses baseline conditions were extracted from the average of two seconds before stimulus onset, and the corresponding response was computed as the mean HbO signal between 2 and 4 seconds post-stimuli onset in the case of the 2-second stimuli or between 3 and 5 seconds in the case of the stimuli of 3-second duration. 
A paired t-test was used to determine if there was a significant difference between the mean HRF, the mean baseline and their corresponding standard deviations. A level of alpha=0.05 was considered for statistical significance. Since this is a channel-by-channel comparison, corrections for false positives were carried out (Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate) 10. A two-tailed test was used to assess activation with respect to baseline (hypotheses 1, 2 and 3 ) while one-tailed test was used when a response was expected to be larger in a specific condition (hypothesis 4). For the exploratory tests, the two conditions (left and right finger-tapping, both durations combined) were contrasted.

Data from the GLM estimation of the HRF (variable output.dcAvg.timeSeries) were extracted for each participant. Then, the mean time courses of the estimated HRF were computed for each condition (silence, speech, and noise) and for each region of interest ROI (Left Inferior Frontal Gyrus, left and right superior temporal [Heschl's] gyrus, and occipital).  Channels corresponding to each ROI were chosen as described by Luke et al.3. From these averaged time courses baseline conditions were extracted from the average of two seconds before stimulus onset, and the corresponding response was computed as the maximum HbO signal between 5 and 7 seconds post-stimuli onset. 
Normality was not tested with Shapiro-Wilk or any other tests, due to the relatively small sample size (n=17) non-normality was assumed. A Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine if there was a significant difference between the median of any two groups involved in the hypotheses under test. This is a non-parametric test, appropriate for paired data. A level of alpha=0.05 was considered for statistical significance. Since a few ROI were chosen a priori, no corrections for false positives were carried out (false-discovery rate, Bonferroni, etc.) 7,8. A two-tailed test was used to assess activation with respect to baseline (hypotheses 1,  4,  6, and 7 ) while one-tailed test was used when a response was expected to be larger in a specific ROI (hypotheses  2, 3, and 5).

Data were processed and analyzed in MATLAB R2017b (The MathWorks, Natick, MA) using Homer3  (v1.54.0) 1 and custom-made scripts, as illustrated in Figure 2. First, the raw time-series went through a quality control process where readings with very high or very low optical density changes, insufficient signal to noise ratio (SNR were excluded from further analysis, using the hmrR_PruneChannels function (dRange 0  to 1e7, SNRthresh=5, SDrange=0.45). Then, the raw data were transformed to units of change in optical density (?OD). Motion artifacts were identified on a channel-by-channel basis using the hmrR_MotionArtifactByChannel function. Briefly, if the signal amplitude was larger than 5 (AMPthresh) or the standard deviation augmented by a factor of 50 (SDthresh) over a time window of 1 s (tMotion), then a segment of the time series of 1s length (tMask) was identified as motion artifact. The data in the motion contaminated segments was interpolated by a Savitzky-Golay spline using the hmrR_MotionCorrectSplineSG function with a frame size of 2.5 seconds, which is shorter than the stimulus to avoid smoothing out the hemodynamic response 2, then if a stimulus was identified to contain a motion artifact within a -2 to 10 seconds window it was rejected using the hmrR_StimRejection function. Finally the OD data was bandpass filtered between 0.01 and 0.7 Hz, as instructed by Luke et al.3. OD data was converted into Hb concentration values using the modified Beer-Lambert law without any assumption of partial pathlength factors, hence the resulting units are micromolar*mm. The individual HRF were estimated via a General Linear Model (hmrR_GLM). The analyzed range was from 2 seconds before stimulus onset to 13 seconds post-stimulation. The GLM was solved by ordinary least squares 4. A consecutive series of 1-second wide gaussian functions interspaced 1 second was used as basis function. Channels spaced by less than 15 mm were considered short-separation and the short channel with the greatest correlation was used to regress the superficial hemodynamics from the estimated HRF 5,6. A polynomial correction of order 3 was implemented. No contrast vector was provided at this stage of the analysis.

The individual HRF were estimated via a General Linear Model (hmrR_GLM). The analyzed range was from 2 seconds before stimulus onset to 12 seconds post-stimulation. The GLM was solved by ordinary least squares 4. A consecutive series of 1-second wide gaussian functions interspaced 1 second was used as basis function.

Data from the GLM estimation of the HRF (variable output.dcAvg. dataTimeSeries and output.dcAvgStd.dataTimeSeries) were extracted for each participant. Then, the mean time courses of the estimated HRF were computed for each condition (2 sec. left finger-tapping, 3 sec. left finger-tapping, 2 sec. right finger-tapping & 3 sec. right finger-tapping). From these averaged time courses baseline conditions were extracted from the average of two seconds before stimulus onset, and the corresponding response was computed as the mean HbO signal between 2 and 4 seconds post-stimuli onset in the case of the 2-second stimuli or between 3 and 5 seconds in the case of the stimuli of 3-second duration. 
A paired t-test was used to determine if there was a significant difference between the mean HRF, the mean baseline and their corresponding standard deviations. A level of alpha=0.05 was considered for statistical significance. Since this is a channel-by-channel comparison, corrections for false positives were carried out (Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate) 10. A two-tailed test was used to assess activation with respect to baseline (hypotheses 1, 2 and 3 ) while one-tailed test was used when a response was expected to be larger in a specific condition (hypothesis 4). For the exploratory tests, the two conditions (left and right finger-tapping, both durations combined) were contrasted.
